# Plasmodium_Interactome
An interactive visualization and graphical user interface for the data in
Hillier et al. (2019), DOI [10.1016/j.celrep.2019.07.019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.07.019).

Nodes (genes) colored according to putative protein complex cluster (colors
repeat themselves, black is no cluster predicted).

Blue lines show interactions with selected gene, black are interactions among
the gene's neighbors.
