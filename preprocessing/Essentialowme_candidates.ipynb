Following the initial liver-stage infection, parasites transform into merozoites, infecting red blood cells (RBCs). Repeated RBC infection then occurs during the blood-stage infection, while patients experience various malarial symptoms. Protective immune responses are elicited by this systemic infection, but excessive responses are sometimes harmful for hosts. As parasites infect only RBCs and their immediate precursors during this stage, direct parasite-host interactions occur primarily in the environment surrounded by endothelial lining of blood vessels. The spleen is the major organ where the immune system encounters infected RBCs, causing immunological responses. Its tissue structure is markedly altered during malarial infection in mice and humans. Plasmodium falciparum parasites inside RBCs express proteins, such as PfEMP-1 and RIFIN, transported to the RBC surfaces in order to evade immunological attack by sequestering themselves in the peripheral vasculature avoiding spleen or by direct immune cell inhibition through inhibitory receptors. Host cell production of regulatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-27 limits excessive immune responses, avoiding tissue damage. The regulation of the protective and inhibitory immune responses through host-parasite interactions allows chronic Plasmodium infection.

In this investigation, the strength of intramolecular hydrogen bond (IHB) in five analogs of TFM (ATFM) has been analyzed employing density functional theory (DFT) using B3LYP/6-311++G (d, p) level and molecular orbital analysis in the gas phase and water solution. A detailed electronic structure study has been performed using the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) and the hydrogen bond energies (EHB) of stable conformer obtained in the range of 76-97 kJ/mol, as a medium hydrogen bond. The effect of substitution on the IHB nature has been studied by natural bond orbital analysis (NBO). 1H NMR calculations show an upward trend in the proton chemical shift of the enolic proton in the chelated ring (14.5 to 15.7ppm) by increasing the IHB strength. All the calculations confirmed the strongest IHB in 5-F-ATFM and the weakest IHB in 2-F-ATFM.

Due to increasing in P.\\xa0falciparum resistance to the first-line antimalarial drugs, an effective vaccine for the control and elimination of malaria infection is urgent. Because the pathogenesis of malaria disease results from blood-stage infection, and all of the symptoms and clinical illness of malaria occur during this stage, there is a strong rationale to develop vaccine against this stage. In the present study, different structural-vaccinology and immuno informatics tools were applied to design an effective antibody-inducing multi-epitope vaccine against the blood-stage of P.\\xa0falciparum. The designed multi-epitope vaccine was composed of three main parts including B cell epitopes, T helper (Th) cell epitopes, and two adjuvant motives (HP91 and RS09), which were linked to each other via proper linkers. B cell and T cell epitopes were derived from four protective antigens expressed on the surface of merozoites, which are critical to invade the erythrocytes. HP91 and RS09 adjuvants and Th cell epitopes were used to induce, enhance and direct the best form of humoral immune-response against P.\\xa0falciparum surface merozoite antigens. The vaccine construct was modeled, and after model quality evaluation and refinement by different software, the high-quality 3D-structure model of the vaccine was achieved.

These are used to explain peptides' immunological behaviour when used as vaccine components in the Aotus model. Despite the great similarity between human and Aotus immune system molecules, around 50% of Aotus allele molecules lack a counterpart in the human immune system which could lead to an Aotus-specific vaccine. It was also confirmed that functional Plasmodium falciparum' conserved proteins are immunologically silent (in both the animal model and in-silico prediction); they must therefore be modified to elicit an appropriate immune response.

Polymorphic characters in both allelic types were caused by amino acid substitutions, insertions, and deletions. Amino acid substitutions were mainly occurred at the alanine heptad repeat domains, whereas most insertions and deletions were found at the glutamate rich domain. Overall patterns of amino acid polymorphisms detected in Myanmar pfmsp-3 were similar in the global pfmsp-3 population, but novel amino acid changes were observed in Myanmar pfmsp-3 with low frequencies.

How the parasite maintains the IMC-SPM connection and establishes a dome-like structure of SPM to support cell elongation is unclear. Here, we show that palmitoylation of N-terminal cysteines of two IMC proteins (ISP1/ISP3) regulates the IMC localization of ISP1/ISP3 and zygote-to-ookinete differentiation. Palmitoylation of ISP1/ISP3 is catalyzed by an IMC-residing palmitoyl-S-acyl-transferase (PAT) DHHC2. Surprisingly, DHHC2 undergoes self-palmitoylation at C-terminal cysteines via its PAT activity, which controls DHHC2 localization in IMC after zygote formation. IMC-anchored ISP1 and ISP3 interact with microtubule component Î²-tubulin, serving as tethers to maintain the proper structure of SPM during zygote elongation. This study identifies the first PAT-substrate pair in malaria parasites and uncovers a protein palmitoylation cascade regulating microtubule cytoskeleton.',\n",

The enzymes are synthesized as inactive zymogens (pro-PMs), and the mechanism of their conversion to the active, mature forms has not been clearly elucidated. Our structural investigations of vacuolar pro-PMs with truncated prosegment (pro-tPMs) reveal that the formation of the S-shaped dimer is their innate property. Further structural studies, biochemical analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that disruption of the Tyr-Asp loop (121p-4), coordinated with the movement of the loop L1 (237-247) and helix H2 (101p-113p), is responsible for the extension of the pro-mature region (harboring the cleavage site). Consequently, under acidic pH conditions, these structural changes result in the dissociation of the dimers to monomers and the protonation of the residues in the prosegment prompts its unfolding. Subsequently, we demonstrated that the active site of the monomeric pro-tPMs with the unfolded prosegment is accessible for peptide substrate binding; in contrast, the active site is blocked in folded prosegment form of pro-tPMs. Thus, we propose a novel mechanism of auto-activation of vacuolar pro-tPMs that under acidic conditions can form a catalytically competent active site. One monomer cleaves the prosegment of the other one through a trans-activation process, resulting in formation of mature enzyme. As a result, once a mature enzyme is generated, it leads to the complete conversion of all the inactive pro-tPMs to their mature form.

The current study compared long-term changes in the genetic diversity and structure of co-endemic Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax populations. The study was conducted in Papua Indonesia, where high-grade chloroquine resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax led to a universal policy of Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) in 2006. Microsatellite typing and population genetic analyses were undertaken on available isolates collected between 2004 and 2017 from patients with uncomplicated malaria (n = 666 P. falciparum and n = 615 P. vivax). The proportion of polyclonal P. falciparum infections fell from 28% (38/135) before policy change (2004-2006) to 18% (22/125) at the end of the study (2015-2017); p<0.001. Over the same period, polyclonal P. vivax infections fell from 67% (80/119) to 35% (33/93); p<0.001. P. falciparum strains persisted for up to 9 years compared to 3 months for P. vivax, reflecting higher rates of outbreeding in the latter. Sub-structure was observed in the P. falciparum population, but not in P. vivax, confirming different patterns of outbreeding. The P. falciparum population exhibited 4 subpopulations that changed in frequency over time. Notably, a sharp rise was observed in the frequency of a minor subpopulation (K2) in the late post-ACT period, accounting for 100% of infections in late 2016-2017. The results confirm epidemiological evidence of reduced P. falciparum and P. vivax transmission over time. The smaller change in P. vivax population structure is consistent with greater outbreeding associated with relapsing infections and highlights the need for radical cure to reduce recurrent infections. The study emphasizes the challenge in disrupting P. vivax transmission and demonstrates the potential of molecular data to inform on the impact of public health interventions.',\n",

To proliferate, non-motile parasites must have access to susceptible red blood cells, which they invade using pairs of parasite ligands and host receptors that define invasion pathways. Parasites can switch invasion pathways, and while this flexibility is thought to facilitate immune evasion, it may also reflect the heterogeneity of red blood cell surfaces within and between hosts. Host genetic background affects red blood cell structure, for example, and red blood cells also undergo dramatic changes in morphology and receptor density as they age. The in vivo consequences of both the accessibility of susceptible cells, and their heterogeneous susceptibility, remain unclear. Here, we measured invasion of laboratory strains of P. falciparum relying on distinct invasion pathways into red blood cells of different ages. We estimated invasion efficiency while accounting for red blood cell accessibility to parasites. This approach revealed different tradeoffs made by parasite strains between the fraction of cells they can invade and their invasion rate into them, and we distinguish \"specialist\" strains from \"generalist\" strains in this context. We developed a mathematical model to show that generalist strains would lead to higher peak parasitemias in vivo compared to specialist strains with similar overall proliferation rates. Thus, the ecology of red blood cells may play a key role in determining the rate of P. falciparum parasite proliferation and malaria virulence.',\n",

This approach holds great promise for the generation of potent drug leads in the quest for therapeutic chemotypes with the potential to overcome the development of clinical resistance. Herein, we present the in\\u2005vitro antiplasmodial and antiproliferative investigation of ferrocenyl Î±-aminocresol conjugates assembled by amalgamation of the organometallic ferrocene unit and an Î±-aminocresol scaffold possessing antimalarial activity. The compounds pursued in the study exhibited higher toxicity towards the chemosensitive (3D7) and -resistant (Dd2) strains of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite than to the human HCC70 triple-negative breast cancer cell line. Indication of cross-resistance was absent for the compounds evaluated against the multi-resistant Dd2 strain. Structure-activity analysis revealed that the phenolic hydroxy group and rotatable Ï bond between the Î±-carbon and NH group of the Î±-amino-o-cresol skeleton are crucial for the biological activity of the compounds. Spectrophotometric techniques and in silico docking simulations performed on selected derivatives suggest that the compounds show a dual mode of action involving hemozoin inhibition and DNA interaction via minor-groove binding. Lastly, compound 9\\u2009a, identified as a possible lead, exhibited preferential binding for the plasmodial DNA isolated from 3D7 P. falciparum trophozoites over the mammalian calf thymus DNA, thereby substantiating the enhanced antiplasmodial activity of the compounds.

Such isolates are prone to selective transmission and thus form a challenge to case management. As most of the rapid malaria diagnostic tests are based on the detection of HRP2 protein in the blood, we attempted to use Glutamate Dehydrogenase (GDH) as a biomarker for the diagnosis of P. falciparum. Recombinant PfGDH was successfully cloned, expressed and purified using the Ni-NTA approach. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against full-length rPfGDH and its peptides. Antibodies for rPfGDH showed a strong immune response against the recombinant protein. However, antibody showed no affinity towards the peptides, which suggests they failed as antigen. Antibodies for rPfGDH significantly detected the GDH in human blood specimens. This is the first report where P. falciparum GDH was detected in malaria cases from various parts of India. The raised polyclonal antibodies had shown an affinity for PfGDH in quantitative ELISA and are capable to be exploited for RDTs.

Such information, particularly when integrated with geospatial data, can have translational applications for a variety of fields, including public health. Estimated effective migration surfaces (EEMS) is an approach that allows visualization of the spatial patterns in genomic data to understand population structure and migration. In this study, we developed a workflow to optimize the resolution of spatial grids used to generate EEMS migration maps and applied this optimized workflow to estimate migration of Plasmodium falciparum in Cambodia and bordering regions of Thailand and Vietnam.\\nThe optimal density of EEMS grids was determined based on a new workflow created using density clustering to define genomic clusters and the spatial distance between genomic clusters. Topological skeletons were used to capture the spatial distribution for each genomic cluster and to determine the EEMS grid density; i.e., both genomic and spatial clustering were used to guide the optimization of EEMS grids. Model accuracy for migration estimates using the optimized workflow was tested and compared to grid resolutions selected without the optimized workflow. As a test case, the optimized workflow was applied to genomic data generated from P. falciparum sampled in Cambodia and bordering regions, and migration maps were compared to estimates of malaria endemicity, as well as geographic properties of the study area, as a means of validating observed migration patterns.\\nOptimized grids displayed both high model accuracy and reduced computing time compared to grid densities selected in an unguided manner. In addition, EEMS migration maps generated for P. falciparum using the optimized grid corresponded to estimates of malaria endemicity and geographic properties of the study region that might be expected to impact malaria parasite migration, supporting the validity of the observed migration patterns.\\nOptimized grids reduce spatial uncertainty in the EEMS contours that can result from user-defined parameters, such as the resolution of the spatial grid used in the model.

Plasmodium merozoite surface protein 4 (MSP4) has been listed as a blood-stage subunit vaccine candidate for malaria. Infection with Plasmodium ovale species including P. ovale wallikeri and P. ovale curtisi, is also a source of malaria burden in tropical regions where it is sometimes mixed with other Plasmodium species. However, little is known about P. ovale MSP4.\\nThe msp4 gene was amplified through polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA extracted from blood samples of 46 patients infected with P. ovale spp. and amplified products were sequenced. Open reading frames predicted as immunogenic peptides consisting of 119 and 97 amino acids of P. ovale curtisi MSP4 (PocMSP4) and P. ovale wallikeri MSP4 (PowMSP4), respectively, were selected for protein expression. Recombinant proteins (rPoMSP4) were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, analysed, and immunized in BALB/c mice. The specificity of anti-MSP4-immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies was evaluated by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and cellular immune responses were analysed via lymphocyte proliferation assays.\\nFull peptide sequences of PocMSP4 and PowMSP4 were completely conserved in all clinical isolates, except in the epidermal growth factor-like domain at the carboxyl terminus where only one mutation was observed in one P. o. wallikeri isolate. Further, truncated PoMSP4 segments were successfully expressed and purified as ~\\u200932\\xa0kDa proteins. Importantly, high antibody responses with end-point titres ranging from 1:10,000 to 1:2,560,000 in all immunized mouse groups were observed, with high IgG avidity to PocMSP4 (80.5%) and PowMSP4 (92.3%). Furthermore, rPocMSP4 and rPowMSP4 cross-reacted with anti-PowMSP4-specific or anti-PocMSP4-specific antibodies. Additionally, anti-PoMSP4 IgG antibodies showed broad immuno-specificity in reacting against rPoMSP1 and rPoAMA1. Lastly, PocMSP4- and PowMSP4-immunized mice induced cellular immune responses with PocMSP4 (36%) and PowMSP4 cells (15.8%) during splenocyte proliferation assays.\\nFindings from this study suggest conservation in PoMSP4 protein sequences and high immunogenicity was observed in rPoMSP4. Furthermore, induction of immune responses in PocMSP4- and PowMSP4-immunized mice informed that both humoral and cellular immune responses play crucial roles for PoMSP4 in protection.',\n",

The CIDRÎ±1 domain of PfEMP1 is responsible for binding host endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), and increasing evidence support that this interaction triggers severe malaria, accounting for the majority of malaria-related deaths. In high transmission regions, children develop immunity to severe malaria after the first few infections. This immunity is believed to be mediated by antibodies targeting and inhibiting PfEMP1, causing infected erythrocytes to circulate and be cleared in the spleen. The development of immunity to malaria coincides with acquisition of broad antibody reactivity across the CIDRÎ±1 protein family. Altogether, this identifies CIDRÎ±1 as an important vaccine target. However, the antigenic diversity of the CIDRÎ±1 domain family is a challenge for vaccine development.\\nImmune responses in mice vaccinated with Virus-Like Particles (VLP) presenting CIDRÎ±1 antigens were investigated. Antibody reactivity was tested to a panel of recombinant CIDRÎ±1 domains, and the antibodies ability to inhibit EPCR binding by the recombinant CIDRÎ±1 domains was tested in Luminex-based multiplex assays.\\nVLP-presented CIDRÎ±1.4 antigens induced a rapid and strong IgG response capable of inhibiting EPCR-binding of multiple CIDRÎ±1 domains mainly within the group A CIDRÎ±1.4-7 subgroups.\\nThe study observations mirror those from previous CIDRÎ±1 vaccine studies using other vaccine constructs and platforms. This suggests that broad CIDRÎ±1 antibody reactivity may be achieved through vaccination with a limited number of CIDRÎ±1 variants. In addition, this study suggest that this may be achieved through vaccination with a human compatible VLP vaccine platform.',\n",

Again, this study identified 27 different Pfmsp-2 genotypes, ranging from 140 to 568\\xa0bp in size, including 15 belonging to the 3D7-type and 12 to the FC27 allelic families. The analysis of the MSP-1 and MSP-2 peptides indicates that the region of the alignment corresponding K1 polymorphism had the highest similarity in the MSP1and MSP2 clade followed by MAD20 with 93% to 100% homology. Therefore, population structure of P. falciparum isolates is identical to that of other areas in Africa, suggesting that vaccine developed with K1 and MAD20 of Pfmsp1 allelic variant could be protective for Africa children but these findings requires further genetic and immunological investigations. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) was significantly higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) for Pfmsp-2 loci (3.82), as compare with Pfmsp-1 (2.51) and heterozygotes ranged from 0.55 for Pfmsp-1 to 0.96 for Pfmsp-2.\\nHigh genetic diversity and allelic frequencies in P. falciparum isolates indicate a persisting high level of transmission.

Hence, site-specific substitution rates were estimated over Plasmodium evolution at each amino acid sites, and the PfCRT tertiary structure was predicted in both inward-facing (open-to-vacuole) and occluded states through homology modeling using DMT template structures sharing <15% sequence identity with PfCRT. We found that the vacuolar-half and membrane-spanning domain (and\\xa0especially the transmembrane helix 9)\\xa0of PfCRT were more conserved, supporting that its physiological substrate is expelled out of the parasite DV. In the PfCRT occluded state, some evolutionary conserved sites, including positions related to drug resistance mutations, participate in a putative binding pocket located at the core of the PfCRT membrane-spanning domain. Through structural comparison with experimentally-characterized DMT transporters, we identified several conserved PfCRT amino acid sites located in this pocket as robust candidates for mediating substrate transport. Finally, in silico mutagenesis revealed that drug resistance mutations caused drastic changes in the electrostatic potential of the transporter vacuolar entry and pocket, facilitating the escape of protonated CQ and PPQ from the parasite DV.',\n",

The major surface antigen on Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites, the circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP), has been an attractive target for vaccine development and most protective antibodies studied to date interact with the central NANP repeat region of PfCSP. However, it remains unclear what structural and functional characteristics correlate with better protection by one antibody over another. Binding to the junctional region between the N-terminal domain and central NANP repeats has been proposed to result in superior protection: this region initiates with the only NPDP sequence followed immediately by NANP. Here, we isolated antibodies in Kymab mice immunized with full-length recombinant PfCSP and two protective antibodies were selected for further study with reactivity against the junctional region. X-ray and EM structures of two monoclonal antibodies, mAb667 and mAb668, shed light on their differential affinity and specificity for the junctional region. Importantly, these antibodies also bind to the NANP repeat region with equal or better affinity. A comparison with an NANP-only binding antibody (mAb317) revealed roughly similar but statistically distinct levels of protection against sporozoite challenge in mouse liver burden models, suggesting that junctional antibody protection might relate to the ability to also cross-react with the NANP repeat region. Our findings indicate that additional efforts are necessary to isolate a true junctional antibody with no or much reduced affinity to the NANP region to elucidate the role of the junctional epitope in protection.',\n",

Nonetheless, today there are still significant gaps in our understanding of the population genetics and evolutionary history of P. vivax, particularly because of a lack of genetic data from Africa. To address these gaps, we genotyped 14 microsatellite loci in 834 samples obtained from 28 locations in 20 countries from around the world.

       " '32147299': 'Malaria transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) aim to inhibit parasite fertilization or further development within the mosquito midgut. Because TBV-immunized individuals reduce the transmission of malaria parasites to mosquito vectors, TBVs could serve as a promising strategy to eliminate malaria. We previously reported that a male specific protein, PyMiGS (Plasmodium yoelii microgamete surface protein), is localized to the surface of microgametes and anti-PyMiGS antibodies have strong transmission-blocking activity. In this study we determine a region of PyMiGS that contains epitopes inducing potent transmission-blocking antibodies. PyMiGS excluding the N-terminal signal sequence and C-terminal hydrophobic region (PyMiGS-full) was divided into five overlapping regions, named I through V, and corresponding truncated recombinant proteins were produced. Anti-region V antibody, affinity-purified from anti-PyMiGS-full rabbit antiserum, significantly reduced the number of oocysts in a mosquito membrane-feeding assay. Antibodies from mice immunized with PyMiGS-V recognized the microgamete surface and showed higher transmission-blocking efficacy than antibodies obtained by PyMiGS-full immunization. These results indicate that the major epitopes for transmission-blocking antibodies are within region V at the C-terminal region of PyMiGS. Therefore, region V of MiGS could be a promising pre-fertilization TBV candidate antigen.',\n",

Herein we reported the characterization of the PvHAP2 for its potential as a TBV candidate for P. vivax. The HAP2/GCS1 domain of PvHAP2 was expressed in the baculovirus expression system and the recombinant protein was used to raise antibodies in rabbits. Indirect immunofluorescence assays showed that anti-PvHAP2 antibodies reacted only with the male gametocytes on blood smears. Direct membrane feeding assays were conducted using four field P. vivax isolates in Anopheles dirus. At a mean infection intensity of 72.4, 70.7, 51.3, and 15.6 oocysts/midgut with the control antibodies, anti-PvHAP2 antibodies significantly reduced the midgut oocyst intensity by 40.3, 44.4, 61.9, and 89.7%. Whereas the anti-PvHAP2 antibodies were not effective in reducing the infection prevalence at higher parasite exposure (51.3-72.4 oocysts/midgut in the control group), the anti-PvHAP2 antibodies reduced infection prevalence by 50% at a low challenge (15.6 oocysts/midgut). Multiple sequence alignment showed 100% identity among these Thai P. vivax isolates, suggesting that polymorphism may not be an impediment for the utilization of PvHAP2 as a TBV antigen. In conclusion, our results suggest that PvHAP2 could serve as a TBV candidate for P. vivax, and further optimization and evaluation are warranted.',\n",

One of the main reasons of disease survival is diversity of vectors and parasites in different malaria regions that have their specific features, behaviour and biology. Therefore, specific regional strategies are necessary for successful control of malaria. One of the tools that needs to be developed for elimination and prevention of reintroduction of malaria is a vaccine that interrupt malaria transmission (VIMTs). VIMT is a broad concept that should be adjusted to the biological characteristics of the disease in each region. One type of VIMT is a vector-based vaccine that affects the sexual stage of Plasmodium life cycle. According to recent studies, the aminopeptidase N-1 of Anopheles gambiae (AgAPN-1) is as a potent vector-based VIMT with considerable inhibition activity against the sexual stage of Plasmodium parasite.\\nSystems for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3'-RACE) and genome walking methods were used for sequence determination of apn-1 gene from Anopheles stephensi and distinct bioinformatics software were used for structural analysis. AsAPN-1 was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cell line using the baculovirus expression system. Recombinant AsAPN-1 was purified under the hybrid condition and its biological activity was assayed.\\nAsapn-1 gene and its coded protein from An. stephensi were characterized for the first time in this study.

Then, we applied the best models for a virtual screening of a large database of chemical compounds. The top computational predictions were evaluated experimentally against asexual blood stages of both sensitive and multi-drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains. Among them, two compounds, LabMol-149 and LabMol-152, showed potent antiplasmodial activity at low nanomolar concentrations (EC50 <500 nM) and low cytotoxicity in mammalian cells.

In order to explore biogenesis of the reduced organellar ribosomes of the malaria parasite, we identified three nuclear-encoded homologs of YihA in Plasmodium falciparum. PfYihA1 targeted to the parasite apicoplast, PfYihA2 to the mitochondrion, and PfYihA3 was found in both the apicoplast and cytosol. The three PfYihA, expressed as recombinant proteins, were active GTPases and interacted with surrogate E. coli ribosomes in a nucleotide-independent manner. In vivo complexation of PfYihA with parasite organellar and/or cytosolic LSU was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies. Mitochondrial PfYihA2 carries a large C-ter extension with a strongly positively charged stretch. We hypothesise that this is important in compensating for the absence of helices of the central protuberance in the fragmented rRNA of Plasmodium mitoribosomes and may provide additional contact sites to aid in complex assembly. Combined with previous reports, our results indicate that P. falciparum mitochondria are likely to assemble ribosomes with the aid of PfEngA, PfObg1 and PfYihA2 GTPases while apicoplast ribosomes might use PfYihA1 and 3 in combination with other factors.',\n",

We previously reported abiotic confinement extends the functional longevity of primary hepatocytes in a microfluidic platform and set out to instill confinement in a microtiter plate platform while maintaining optical accessibility for HC/RI; with an end-goal of producing an improved P. vivax liver stage culture model. We developed a novel fabrication process in which a PDMS soft mold embosses hepatocyte-confining microfeatures into polystyrene, resulting in microfeature-based hepatocyte confinement (Î¼HEP) slides and plates. Our process was optimized to form both microfeatures and culture wells in a single embossing step, resulting in a 100 Î¼m-thick bottom ideal for HC/RI, and was found inexpensively amendable to microfeature design changes. Microfeatures improved intrahepatic parasite infection rates and Î¼HEP systems were used to reconfirm the activity of reference antimalarials in phenotypic dose-response assays.

Randomisation was centralised, using stratification by cohort and blocks of variable size, and syringes were masked by opaque labels. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with any grade 3 or higher adverse reaction to vaccination up until day 35. Safety at later time points as well as humoral and cellular immunogenicity were assessed in secondary endpoints. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02658253.\\nBetween April 19, 2016, and July 13, 2017, 68 women (18 in France, 50 in Burkina Faso) of 101 assessed for eligibility were included. No serious adverse event related to the vaccine occurred. PRIMVAC antibody titres increased with each dose and seroconversion was observed in all women vaccinated with PRIMVAC (n=57). PRIMVAC antibody titres reached a peak (geometric mean 11\\u2008843Â·0, optical density [OD] 1Â·0, 95% CI 7559Â·8-18\\u2008552Â·9 with 100 Î¼g dose and GLA-SE) 1 week after the third vaccination (day 63). Compared with Alhydrogel, GLA-SE tended to improve the PRIMVAC antibody response (geometric mean 2163Â·5, OD 1Â·0, 95% CI 1315Â·7-3557Â·7 with 100 Î¼g dose and Alhydrogel at day 63). 1 year after the last vaccination, 20 (71%) of 28 women who were vaccinated with PRIMVAC/Alhydrogel and 26 (93%) of 28 women who were vaccinated with PRIMVAC/GLA-SE still had anti-PRIMVAC antibodies, although antibody magnitude was markedly lower (452Â·4, OD 1Â·0, 95% CI 321Â·8-636Â·1 with 100 Î¼g dose and GLA-SE). These antibodies reacted with native homologous VAR2CSA expressed by NF54-CSA infected erythrocytes (fold change from baseline at day 63 with 100 Î¼g dose and GLA-SE: 10Â·74, 95% CI 8Â·36-13Â·79). Limited cross-recognition, restricted to sera collected from women that received the 100 Î¼g PRIMVAC dose, was observed against heterologous VAR2CSA variants expressed by FCR3-CSA (fold change from baseline at day 63: 1Â·49, 95% CI 1Â·19-1Â·88) and 7G8-CSA infected erythrocytes (1Â·2, 1Â·08-1Â·34).\\nPRIMVAC adjuvanted with Alhydrogel or GLA-SE had an acceptable safety profile, was immunogenic, and induced functional antibodies reacting with the homologous VAR2CSA variant expressed by NF54-CSA infected erythrocytes. Cross-reactivity against heterologous VAR2CSA variants was limited and only observed in the higher dose group. An alternate schedule of immunisation, antigen dose, and combinations with other VAR2CSA-based vaccines are envisaged to improve the cross-reactivity against heterologous VAR2CSA variants.\\nBundesministerium fÃ¼r Bildung und Forschung, through Kreditanstalt fÃ¼r Wiederaufbau, Germany; Inserm, and Institut National de Transfusion Sanguine, France; Irish Aid, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Ireland.',\n",

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria use pLDH as a target antigen; however, genetic variations in pLDH within the natural population threaten the efficacy of pLDH-based RDTs.\\nGenetic polymorphisms of Plasmodium vivax LDH (PvLDH) and Plasmodium falciparum LDH (PfLDH) in Myanmar isolates were analysed by nucleotide sequencing analysis. Genetic polymorphisms and the natural selection of PvLDH and PfLDH were analysed using DNASTAR, MEGA6, and DnaSP ver. 5.10.00 programs. The genetic diversity and natural selection of global PvLDH and PfLDH were also analysed. The haplotype network of global PvLDH and PfLDH was constructed using NETWORK ver. 5.0.0.3. Three-dimensional structures of PvLDH and PfLDH were built with YASARA Structure ver. 18.4.24 and the impact of mutations on structural change and stability was evaluated with SDM ver. 2, CUPSAT and MAESTROweb.\\nForty-nine PvLDH and 52 PfLDH sequences were obtained from Myanmar P. vivax and P. falciparum isolates. Non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino acid changes were identified in both Myanmar PvLDH and PfLDH. Amino acid changes were also identified in the global PvLDH and PfLDH populations, but they did not produce structural alterations in either protein. Low genetic diversity was observed in global PvLDH and PfLDH, which may be maintained by a strong purifying selection.\\nThis study extends knowledge for genetic diversity and natural selection of global PvLDH and PfLDH. Although amino acid changes were observed in global PvLDH and PfLDH, they did not alter the conformational structures of the proteins. These suggest that PvLDH and PfLDH are genetically well-conserved in global populations, which indicates that they are suitable antigens for diagnostic purpose and attractive targets for drug development.',\n",

In the present study, the influence of house characteristics on mosquito distribution and malaria transmission risk was assessed in the city of YaoundÃ©.\\nThe study was conducted from March 2017 to June 2018 in 32 districts of the city of YaoundÃ©. Mosquito collections were performed indoor in 10 to 15 houses per district using CDC light traps. A total of 467 houses, selected randomly were used. A pretested questionnaire was submitted to participants of the study to collect information on the household: the number of people per house, education level, type of walls, presence of ceilings and eaves, number of windows, usage of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), number of bedroom and number of window. Mosquitoes collected were identified morphologically. Anophelines were tested by ELISA to detect infection by Plasmodium parasites. General Estimating Equations adjusting for repeated measures in the same house fitting negative binomial analysis were used to assess the influence of house characteristics on mosquito distribution.\\nA total of 168,039 mosquitoes were collected; Culex spp emerged as the predominant species (96.48%), followed by Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) (2.49%). Out of the 1033 An. gambiae s.l. identified by PCR, 90.03% were Anopheles coluzzii and the remaining were An. gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) (9.97%). The high number of people per household, the presence of screens on window and the possession of LLINs were all associated with fewer mosquitoes collected indoors, whilst opened eaves, the high number of windows, the presence of holes in walls and living close to breeding sites were associated with high densities of mosquitoes indoor. Out of 3557 Anophelines tested using ELISA CSP, 80 were found infected by Plasmodium falciparum parasites. The proportion of mosquitoes infected did not vary significantly according to house characteristics.\\nThe study indicated that several house characteristics such as, the presence of holes on walls, opened eaves, unscreened window and living close to breeding sites, favored mosquito presence in houses. Promoting frequent use of LLINs and house improvement measures, such as the use of screen on windows, closing eaves, cleaning the nearby environment, should be integrated in strategies to improve malaria control in the city of YaoundÃ©.',\n",

In paratransgenesis, symbiont microorganisms are used for distorting or blocking the parasite life-cycle, affecting the fitness and longevity of vectors or reducing the vectorial competence. It has been revealed recently that bacteria could be used as potent tools for double stranded RNA production and delivery to insects. Moreover, findings showed that RNase III mutant bacteria are more competent for this aim. Asaia spp. have been introduced as potent paratransgenesis candidates for combating malaria and, based on their specific features for this goal, could be considered as effective dsRNA production and delivery tools to Anopheles spp. Therefore, we decided to characterize the rnc gene and its related protein to provide the basic required information for creating an RNase III mutant Asaia bacterium.\\nAsaia bacteria were isolated from field-collected Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. The rnc gene and its surrounding sequences were characterized by rapid amplification of genomic ends. RNase III recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 and biological activity of the purified recombinant protein was assayed. Furthermore, Asaia RNaseIII amino acid sequence was analyzed by in silico approaches such as homology modeling and docking to determine its structural properties.\\nIn this study, the structure of rnc gene and its related operon from Asaia sp. was determined. In addition, by performing superimposition and docking with specific substrate, the structural features of Asaia RNaseIII protein such as critical residues which are involved and essential for proper folding of active site, binding of magnesium ions and double stranded RNA molecule to protein and cleaving of dsRNA molecules, were determined.\\nIn this study, the basic and essential data for creating an RNase III mutant Asaia sp. strain, which is the first step of developing an efficient RNAi-based paratransgenesis tool, were acquired. Asaia sp. have been found in different medically-important vectors and these data are potentially very helpful for researchers studying paratransgenesis and vector-borne diseases and are interested in applying the RNAi technology in the field.',\n",

However, the CSP-based vaccine RTS,S provides only marginal protection, highlighting the need for innovative vaccine design and development. Here we design and characterize expression and folding of P. berghei (Pb) and P. falciparum (Pf) TRAP-CSP fusion proteins, and evaluate immunogenicity and sterilizing immunity in mice. TRAP N-terminal domains were fused to the CSP C-terminal Î±TSR domain with or without the CSP repeat region, expressed in mammalian cells, and evaluated with or without N-glycan shaving. Pb and Pf fusions were each expressed substantially better than the TRAP or CSP components alone; furthermore, the fusions but not the CSP component could be purified to homogeneity and were well folded and monomeric. As yields of TRAP and CSP fragments were insufficient, we immunized BALB/c mice with Pb TRAP-CSP fusions in AddaVax adjuvant and tested the effects of absence or presence of the CSP repeats and absence or presence of high mannose N-glycans on total antibody titer and protection from infection by mosquito bite both 2.5 months and 6 months after the last immunization. Fusions containing the repeats were completely protective against challenge and re-challenge, while those lacking repeats were significantly less effective. These results correlated with higher total antibody titers when repeats were present. Our results show that TRAP-CSP fusions increase protein antigen production, have the potential to yield effective vaccines, and also guide design of effective proteins that can be encoded by nucleic acid-based and virally vectored vaccines.',\n",

In the current study, we investigated the level of genetic diversity and natural selection of pftrap sequences in P. falciparum isolates from Iran (n\\xa0=\\xa047). The gene diversity of Iranian pftrap sequences was also compared to available global pftrap sequences deposited in the GenBank or PlasmoDB databases (n\\xa0=\\xa0220). Comparison of Iranian PfTRAP sequences with T9/96 reference sequence showed the presence of 35 amino acid changes in 32 positions and a limited variation in repeat sequences, leading to 13 distinct haplotypes. The overall nucleotide diversity (Ï) for the ectodomain of Iranian pftrap sequences was 0.00444\\xa0Â±\\xa00.00043, with the highest diversity in Domain IV. Alignment comparison of global PfTRAP sequences with T9/96 reference sequence indicated 96 amino acid replacements as well as extensive variable repeat sequences (9-23 repeats), which led to 192 haplotypes. Among the global isolates, the lowest nucleotide diversity was detected in French Guianan (0.00428\\xa0Â±\\xa00.00163) and Iranian (0.00444\\xa0Â±\\xa00.00043) pftrap sequences, and the most variation was observed in domains II and IV in all populations. The dN-dS value displayed the evidence of positive selection due to recombination and immune system pressure. The Fst analysis revealed a gene flow between African populations; however, genetic differentiation observed between Iranian and other populations probably was due to gene flow barriers. Both conserved and variable epitopes were predicted in B- and T-cell epitopes of PfTRAP antigen. The obtained results from this study could be helpful for developing a PfTRAP-based malaria vaccine.',\n",

Serological surveillance will be particularly important in areas of low or periodic transmission because patient antibody responses can provide a measure of historical exposure. While methods for detecting host antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax are well established, development of serological assays for Plasmodium knowlesi, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae have been inhibited by a lack of immunodiagnostic candidates due to the limited availability of genomic information.\\nUsing the recently completed genome sequences from P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi, a set of 33 candidate cell surface and secreted blood-stage antigens was selected and expressed in a recombinant form using a mammalian expression system. These proteins were added to an existing panel of antigens from P. falciparum and P. vivax and the immunoreactivity of IgG, IgM and IgA immunoglobulins from individuals diagnosed with infections to each of the five different Plasmodium species was evaluated by ELISA. Logistic regression modelling was used to quantify the ability of the responses to determine prior exposure to the different Plasmodium species.\\nUsing sera from European travellers with diagnosed Plasmodium infections, antigens showing species-specific immunoreactivity were identified to select a panel of 22 proteins from five Plasmodium species for serological profiling. The immunoreactivity to the antigens in the panel of sera taken from travellers and individuals living in malaria-endemic regions with diagnosed infections showed moderate power to predict infections by each species, including P. ovale, P. malariae and P. knowlesi. Using a larger set of patient samples and logistic regression modelling it was shown that exposure to P. knowlesi could be accurately detected (AUC\\u2009=\\u200991%) using an antigen panel consisting of the P. knowlesi orthologues of MSP10, P12 and P38.\\nUsing the recent availability of genome sequences to all human-infective Plasmodium spp. parasites and a method of expressing Plasmodium proteins in a secreted functional form, an antigen panel has been compiled that will be useful to determine exposure to these parasites.',\n",

We determined its apicoplast location and in silico 3D protein structure to refocus attention exclusively on U5MTase with tremendous potential for therapeutic intervention in malaria. Around 300 million clinical cases of malaria occur each year in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, resulting in over one million deaths annually, placing malaria among the most serious infectious diseases. Genomic and proteomic research of the clades of parasites containing Pf is progressing slowly and the functions of most of the â¼5300 genes are still unknown.

Maturation of most subtilases requires the presence of an N-terminal propeptide that facilitates folding of the catalytic domain. Following its proteolytic cleavage, the propeptide acts as a transient, tightly bound inhibitor until its eventual complete removal to generate active protease. Here we report the identification of a stand-alone malaria parasite propeptide-like protein, called SUB1-ProM, encoded by a conserved gene that lies in a highly syntenic locus adjacent to three of the four subtilisin-like genes in the Plasmodium genome. Template-based modelling and ab initio structure prediction showed that the SUB1-ProM core structure is most similar to the X-ray crystal structure of the propeptide of SUB1, an essential parasite subtilase that is discharged into the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) to trigger parasite release (egress) from infected host cells. Recombinant Plasmodium falciparum SUB1-ProM was found to be a fast-binding, potent inhibitor of P. falciparum SUB1, but not of the only other essential blood-stage parasite subtilase, SUB2, or of other proteases examined. Mass-spectrometry and immunofluorescence showed that SUB1-ProM is expressed in the PV of blood stage P. falciparum, where it may act as an endogenous inhibitor to regulate SUB1 activity in the parasite.',\n",

In this study, we utilized the baculovirus system to evaluate the expression of three Pfs48/45 proteins including the full-length protein, the 6C domain fragment and the 6C domain mutant to prevent glycosylation. Expression of the recombinant Pfs48/45 proteins was conducted in super Sf9 cells combined with the use of tunicamycin to prevent N-glycosylation. The proteins were then evaluated as immunogens in mice to demonstrate the induction of functionally active polyclonal antibody responses as measured in the standard membrane feeding assay (SMFA). Only the 6C protein was found to exhibit significant transmission-reducing activity. Further characterization of the biologically active 6C protein demonstrated it was homogeneous in terms of size, charge, conformation, absence of glycosylation, and containing proper disulfide bond pairings.

Antibody responses to pregnancy-specific pRBC and VAR2CSA antigens, measured at delivery, were associated with placental malaria (9 studies) and may therefore represent markers of infection, rather than correlates of protection. Antibody responses to pregnancy-specific pRBC, but not recombinant VAR2CSA antigens, were associated with trends towards protection from low birthweight (5 studies).\\nWhilst antibody responses to several antigens were positively associated with the presence of placental and peripheral infections, this review did not identify evidence that any specific antibody response is associated with protection from pregnancy-associated malaria across multiple populations. Further prospective cohort studies using standardized laboratory methods to examine responses to a broad range of antigens in different epidemiological settings and throughout the gestational period, will be necessary to identify and prioritize pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antigens to advance the development of vaccines and serosurveillance tools targeting pregnant women.',\n",

However, interpretation of these results and understanding of their relevance to vaccine efficacy have been hampered by the lack of knowledge on genetic differences between vaccine and CHMI strains, and how these strains are related to parasites in malaria endemic regions.\\nWhole genome sequencing using long-read (Pacific Biosciences) and short-read (Illumina) sequencing platforms was conducted to generate de novo genome assemblies for the vaccine strain, NF54, and for strains used in heterologous CHMI (7G8 from Brazil, NF166.C8 from Guinea, and NF135.C10 from Cambodia).

IgG subclasses were assessed from the immunized mice.\\nIn silico analysis showed that P. vivax exhibits nine genes encoding the ETRAMP family. The ETRAMP family proteins are relatively small molecules with conserved structural features. A total of 6 recombinant ETRAMP proteins were successfully expressed and purified. The serum positivity of P. vivax malaria patients and healthy individuals was evaluated using a protein microarray method. Among the PvETRAMPs, ETRAMP4 showed the highest positivity rate of 62%, comparable to that of PvETRAMP11.2, which served as the positive control, and a typical export pattern of PvETRAMP4 was observed in the P. vivax parasite. The assessment of IgG subclasses in mice immunized with PvETRAMP4 showed high levels of IgG1 and IgG2b. PvETRAMP family proteins were identified and characterized as serological markers.\\nThe relatively high antibody responses to PvETRAMP4 as well as the specific IgG subclasses observed in immunized mice suggest that the ETRAMP family is immunogenic in pathogens and can be used as a protein marker and for vaccine development.',\n",

Consequent upon the recognition of inflammatory cytokine activation and its preponderance for mediating pathology during malaria infection, the study aimed to characterize the expression and functional contribution(s) of IL-35 in Plasmodium berghei (strain ANKA) infected mice.\\nPlasmodium berghei infection in male ICR mice was used as the rodent model of choice. The time course of IL-35 expression in the systemic circulation and tissues of P. berghei infected mice as well as their healthy control counterparts was assessed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry respectively. The effect of modulating IL-35 by recombinant IL-35 protein or neutralizing anti-Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 antibody on the cytokine environment during P. berghei infection was assessed by flow cytometry. Furthermore, the influence of modulating IL-35 on histopathological hallmarks of malaria and disease progression was evaluated.\\nInterleukin-35 was significantly up regulated in serum and tissues of P. berghei infected mice and correlated with parasitaemia. Neutralization of IL-35 significantly enhanced the release of IFN-Î³, decreased the expression of IL-6 and decreased parasitaemia patency. Neutralization of IL-35 was also associated with a tendency towards increased survival as well as the absence of pathological features associated with malaria infection unlike recombinant IL-35 protein administration which sustained a normal course of infection and unfavourable malaria associated histological outcomes in P. berghei infected mice.\\nThese results indicate the involvement of IL-35 in P. berghei induced malaria infection. IL-35 neutralization strategies may represent viable therapeutic modalities beneficial for the resolution of malaria infection.',\n",

Remarkably, most of the compounds exerted significant activities against both stages of the Plasmodium life cycle. The conjugation of various CADs to harmine resulted in the increased antiplasmodial activity relative to harmine. In general, O-harmicines 7 exhibited the highest activity against the erythrocytic stage of both P.\\xa0falciparum strains, whereas N,O-bis harmicines 8 showed the most pronounced activity against P.\\xa0berghei hepatic stages. For the latter compound, molecular dynamics simulations confirmed binding within the ATP binding site of PfHsp90, while the weaker binders, namely 6b and harmine, were found to be positioned away from this structural element. In addition, decomposition of the computed binding free energies into contributions from individual residues suggested guidelines for further derivatization of harmine towards more efficient compounds. Cytotoxicity screening revealed N-harmicines 6 as the least, and O-harmicines 7 as the most toxic compounds.

Defining the role for parasite genomics in driving these high burden settings towards elimination will enhance future control programme planning.\\nAmplicon deep sequencing was used to characterize parasite population genetic diversity at polymorphic Plasmodium falciparum loci, Pfama1 and Pfcsp, at two timepoints in June-July 2016 and January-March 2017 in a high transmission region along the international border between Luapula Province, Zambia and Haut-Katanga Province, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\\nHigh genetic diversity was observed across both seasons and in both countries. No evidence of population structure was observed between parasite populations on either side of the border, suggesting that this region may be one contiguous transmission zone. Despite a decline in parasite prevalence at the sampling locations in Haut-Katanga Province, no genetic signatures of a population bottleneck were detected, suggesting that larger declines in transmission may be required to reduce parasite genetic diversity. Analysing rare variants may be a suitable alternative approach for detecting epidemiologically important genetic signatures in highly diverse populations; however, the challenge is distinguishing true signals from potential artifacts introduced by small sample sizes.\\nContinuing to explore and document the utility of various parasite genotyping approaches for understanding malaria transmission in holoendemic settings will be valuable to future control and elimination programmes, empowering evidence-based selection of tools and methods to address pertinent questions, thus enabling more efficient resource allocation.',\n",

Progress against malaria has recently stalled, highlighting the need for developing novel therapeutics. The parasite haemoglobin degradation pathway, active in the blood stage of the disease where malaria symptoms and lethality manifest, is a well-established drug target. A key enzyme in this pathway is the papain-type protease falcipain-2.\\nThe crystallographic structure of falcipain-2 at 3.45\\xa0Ã resolution was resolved in complex with an (E)-chalcone small-molecule inhibitor. The falcipain-2-(E)-chalcone complex was analysed with reference to previous falcipain complexes and their similarity to human cathepsin proteases.\\nThe (E)-chalcone inhibitor binds falcipain-2 to the rear of the substrate-binding cleft. This is the first structure of a falcipain protease where the rear of the substrate cleft is bound by a small molecule. In this manner, the (E)-chalcone inhibitor mimics interactions observed in protein-based falcipain inhibitors, which can achieve high interaction specificity.\\nThis work informs the search for novel anti-malaria therapeutics that target falcipain-2 by showing the binding site and interactions of the medically privileged (E)-chalcone molecule. Furthermore, this study highlights the possibility of chemically combining the (E)-chalcone molecule with an existing active-site inhibitor of falcipain, which may yield a potent and selective compound for blocking haemoglobin degradation by the malaria parasite.\",\n",

IgG responses against Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum merozoite surface protein-10 (MSP10) were measured as a potential way to identify recent malaria exposure in the Peruvian Amazon.METHODSA field-based study included 470 participants in a longitudinal cohort who completed a comprehensive evaluation: light microscopy and PCR on enrollment, at least 1 monthly follow-up by light microscopy, a second PCR, and serum and dried blood spots for serological analysis at the end of the follow-up. IgG titers against novel mammalian cell-produced recombinant PvMSP10 and PfMSP10 were determined by ELISA.RESULTSDuring the follow-up period, 205 participants were infected, including 171 with P. vivax, 26 with P. falciparum, 6 with infections by both species but at different times, and 2 with mixed infections. Exposure to P. vivax was more accurately identified when serological responses to PvMSP10 were obtained from serum (sensitivity, 58.1%; specificity, 81.8%; AUC: 0.76) than from dried blood spots (sensitivity, 35.2; specificity, 83.5%; AUC: 0.64) (PAUC < 0.001). Sensitivity was highest (serum, 82.9%; dried blood spot, 45.7%) with confirmed P. vivax infections occurring 7-30 days before sample collection; sensitivity decreased significantly in relation to time since last documented infection.

In this study, we investigated the level of polymorphisms, haplotypes, natural selection and population structure of full-length pkmsp4 in 32 clinical samples from Malaysian Borneo along with 4 lab-adapted strains. We found low levels of polymorphism across the gene with exon I showing higher diversity than the exon II. The C- terminal epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains and GPI-anchored region within exon II were mostly conserved with only 2 non-synonymous substitutions. Although 21 amino acid haplotypes were found, the frequency of mutation at the majority of the polymorphic positions was low. We found evidence of negative selection at the exon II of the gene indicating existence of functional constraints. Phylogenetic haplotype network analysis identified shared haplotypes and indicated geographical clustering of samples originating from Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo. High population differentiation values were observed within parasite populations originating from Malaysian Borneo (Kapit, Sarikei and Betong) and laboratory-adapted strains obtained from Peninsular Malaysia and Philippines indicating distinct population structure. This is the first study to genetically characterize the full-length msp4 gene from clinical isolates of P. knowlesi from Malaysia and thus would be very useful for future rational vaccine studies.

Two VAR2CSA-based PM vaccines are currently under clinical trials, but it is still unclear if the use of a single VAR2CSA variant will be sufficient to induce a broad enough humoral response in humans to cross-react with genetically diverse parasite populations. Additional immuno-focusing vaccine strategies may therefore be required to identify functionally conserved antibody epitopes in VAR2CSA. We explored the possibility that conserved epitopes could exist between VAR2CSA from the chimpanzee parasite Plasmodium reichenowi and Plasmodium falciparum sequences. Making use of VAR2CSA recombinant proteins originating from both species, we showed that VAR2CSA from P. reichenowi (Pr-VAR2CSA) binds to the placental receptor CSA with high specificity and affinity. Antibodies raised against Pr-VAR2CSA were able to recognize native VAR2CSA from different P. falciparum genotypes and to inhibit the interaction between CSA and P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes expressing different VAR2CSA variants.

Inhibitors that target Hsp90 function are known to not only kill the parasite, but also reverse resistance of the parasite to traditional antimalarials such as chloroquine. For this reason, Hsp90 has been tagged as a promising antimalarial drug target. As a molecular chaperone, Hsp90 facilitates folding of proteins such as steroid hormone receptors and kinases implicated in cell cycle and development. Central to Hsp90 function is its regulation by several co-chaperones. Various co-chaperones interact with Hsp90 to modulate its co-operation with other molecular chaperones such as Hsp70 and to regulate its interaction with substrates. The role of Hsp90 in the development of malaria parasites continues to receive research attention, and several Hsp90 co-chaperones have been mapped out. Recently, focus has shifted to P. falciparum R2TP proteins, which are thought to couple Hsp90 to a diverse set of client proteins. R2TP proteins are generally known to form a complex with Hsp90, and this complex drives multiple cellular processes central to signal transduction and cell division. Given the central role that the R2TP complex may play, the current review highlights the structure-function features of Hsp90 relative to R2TPs of P. falciparum.',\n",

However, in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum both the function of HP1 phosphorylation and the identity of the protein kinases targeting HP1 are still elusive. In order to functionally analyze phosphorylation of P. falciparum HP1 (PfHP1), we first mapped PfHP1 phosphorylation sites by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of native PfHP1, which identified motifs from which potential kinases could be predicted; in particular, several phosphorylated residues were embedded in motifs rich in acidic residues, reminiscent of targets for P. falciparum casein kinase 2 (PfCK2). Secondly, we tested recombinant PfCK2 and a number of additional protein kinases for their ability to phosphorylate PfHP1 in in vitro kinase assays. These experiments validated our prediction that PfHP1 acts as a substrate for PfCK2. Furthermore, LC-MS/MS analysis showed that PfCK2 phosphorylates three clustered serine residues in an acidic motif within the central hinge region of PfHP1. To study the role of PfHP1 phosphorylation in live parasites we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to generate a number of conditional PfHP1 phosphomutants based on the DiCre/LoxP system. Our studies revealed that neither PfCK2-dependent phosphorylation of PfHP1, nor phosphorylation of the hinge domain in general, affect PfHP1's ability to localize to heterochromatin, and that PfHP1 phosphorylation in this region is dispensable for the proliferation of P. falciparum blood stage parasites.\",\n",

The uneven distribution of its incidence, plus its complex pattern of dispersion, has made ineffective control measures based on global information that lack the necessary detail to understand transmission fully. In this sense, population genetic tools can complement current surveillance. This study describes the genetic diversity and population structure from September 2012 to March 2015 in three geographically distant settlements, Cahuide (CAH), Lupuna (LUP) and Santa Emilia (STE), located in the Peruvian Amazon. A total 777 P. vivax mono-infections, out of 3264, were genotyped. Among study areas, LUP showed 19.7% of polyclonal infections, and its genetic diversity (Hexp) was 0.544. Temporal analysis showed a significant increment of polyclonal infections and Hexp, and the introduction and persistence of a new parasite population since March 2013. In STE, 40.1% of infections were polyclonal, with Hexp = 0.596. The presence of four genetic clusters without signals of clonal expansion and infections with lower parasite densities compared against the other two areas were also found. At least four parasite populations were present in CAH in 2012, where, after June 2014, malaria cases decreased from 213 to 61, concomitant with a decrease in polyclonal infections (from 0.286 to 0.18), and expectedly variable Hexp. Strong signals of gene flow were present in the study areas and wide geographic distribution of highly diverse parasite populations were found. This study suggests that movement of malaria parasites by human reservoirs connects geographically distant malaria transmission areas in the Peruvian Amazon. The maintenance of high levels of parasite genetic diversity through human mobility is a critical barrier to malaria elimination in this region.',\n",
       " '31706081': \"Plasmodium vivax, the chronic relapsing human malaria parasite with the most widespread distribution, possesses proteins associated with the merozoite surface that could be targets for host immune responses and potential vaccine candidates. Of these, the merozoite surface protein 3 of P. vivax (PvMSP3) is an attractive vaccine target as well as a genetic marker for epidemiological surveillance. PvMSP3 comprises a group of protein members encoded by a multigene family. Although some protein members, i.e. PvMSP3Î± and PvMSP3Î², have been targets for molecular and immunological investigations, the most abundantly expressed protein member during late asexual erythrocytic stages, PvMSP3F2 (PVX_97710), remains unexplored. To address domain organization and evolution of this locus, the complete coding sequences of 31 P. vivax isolates from diverse malaria endemic areas of Thailand were analyzed and compared with 10 previously reported sequences. Results revealed that all PvMSP3F2 sequences differed but could be divided into 5 repeat-containing domains flanked by 6 non-repeat domains. Repeat domains II and IV at the 5' portion and domain X at the 3' portion exhibited extensive sequence and length variation whereas repeat domains VI and VIII located at the central region were relatively conserved. Despite a repertoire of PvMSP3F2 variants, predicted coiled-coil tertiary structure and predicted B-cell epitopes seem to be maintained. Evidence of intragenic recombination has been detected among field isolates in Thailand that could enhance sequence diversity at this locus. Non-repeat domains I and IX located at the 5' end and at the 3' portion, respectively, seem to have evolved under purifying selection. Evidence of positive selection was found in non-repeat domains III, V and VII where a number of predicted HLA class I epitopes were identified. Amino acid substitutions in these predicted epitopes could alter predicted peptide binding affinity or abolish peptide epitope property, suggesting that polymorphism in these epitopes conferred host immune evasion. Further studies on PvMSP3F2 are warranted, particularly on interaction with host immune system and the potential role of this PvMSP3 protein member as a vaccine target.\",\n",

Pfs230D1+ was designed to avoid glycosylation and protease digestion, thereby potentially increasing homogeneity and stability. The resulting Pfs230D1+ protein was compared to a previous iteration of the Pfs230\\xa0N-terminal domain, Pfs230C1 (aa 443-731), through physiochemical characterization and in vivo analysis. The induction of functional antibody responses was confirmed via the standard membrane feeding assay (SMFA).\\nPfs230D1+ was produced and purified to an overall yield of 23\\xa0mg/L culture supernatant, a twofold yield increase over Pfs230C1. The Pfs230D1+ protein migrated as a single band via SDS-PAGE and was detected by anti-Pfs230C1 monoclonal antibodies. Evaluation by SDS-PAGE, chromatography (size-exclusion and reversed phase) and capillary isoelectric focusing demonstrated the molecule had improved homogeneity in terms of size, conformation, and charge. Intact mass spectrometry confirmed its molecular weight and that it was free of glycosylation, a key difference to the prior Pfs230C1 protein. The correct formation of the two intramolecular disulfide bonds was initially inferred by binding of a conformation specific monoclonal antibody and directly confirmed by LC/MS and peptide mapping. When injected into mice the Pfs230D1+ protein elicited antibodies that demonstrated transmission-reducing activity, via SMFA, comparable to Pfs230C1.\\nBy elimination of an O-glycosylation site, a potential N-glycosylation site, and two proteolytic cleavage sites, an improved N-terminal Pfs230 fragment was produced, termed D1+, which is non-glycosylated, homogeneous, and biologically active. An intact protein at higher yield than that previously observed for the Pfs230C1 fragment was achieved. The results indicate that Pfs230D1+ protein produced in the baculovirus expression system is an attractive antigen for transmission-blocking vaccine development.',\n",

Details of the translocation pathway are unclear and in this study we focused on the subcellular localization of SBP1 at an early intraerythrocytic stage. We performed immunoelectron microscopy using specific anti-SBP1 antibodies generated by immunization with recombinant SBP1 of P. falciparum. At the early trophozoite (ring form) stage, SBP1 was detected within an electron dense material (EDM) found in the parasite cytoplasm and in the parasitophorous vacuolar (PV) space.

Here we report the purification and biochemical characterization of CTL4 and CTLMA2 from An. gambiae and An. albimanus. CTL4 and CTLMA2 are known to form a disulfide-bridged heterodimer via an N-terminal tri-cysteine CXCXC motif. We demonstrate in vitro that CTL4 and CTLMA2 intermolecular disulfide formation is promiscuous within this motif. Furthermore, CTL4 and CTLMA2 form higher oligomeric states at physiological pH. Both lectins bind specific sugars, including glycosaminoglycan motifs with Î²1-3/Î²1-4 linkages between glucose, galactose and their respective hexosamines. Small-angle x-ray scattering data supports a compact heterodimer between the CTL domains. Recombinant CTL4/CTLMA2 is found to function in vivo, reversing the enhancement of phenol oxidase activity in dsCTL4-treated mosquitoes.

       " '31634979': \"Sexual development is an essential phase in the Plasmodium life cycle, where male gametogenesis is an unusual and extraordinarily rapid process. It produces 8 haploid motile microgametes, from a microgametocyte within 15 minutes. Its unique achievement lies in linking the assembly of 8 axonemes in the cytoplasm to the three rounds of intranuclear genome replication, forming motile microgametes, which are expelled in a process called exflagellation. Surprisingly little is known about the actors involved in these processes. We are interested in kinesins, molecular motors that could play potential roles in male gametogenesis. We have undertaken a functional characterization in Plasmodium berghei of kinesin-8B (PbKIN8B) expressed specifically in male gametocytes and gametes. By generating Pbkin8B-gfp parasites, we show that PbKIN8B is specifically expressed during male gametogenesis and is associated with the axoneme. We created a ÎPbkin8B knockout cell line and analysed the consequences of the absence of PbKIN8B on male gametogenesis. We show that the ability to produce sexually differentiated gametocytes is not affected in ÎPbkin8B parasites and that the 3 rounds of genome replication occur normally. Nevertheless, the development to free motile microgametes is halted and the life cycle is interrupted in vivo. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that intranuclear mitoses are unaffected whereas cytoplasmic microtubules, although assembled in doublets and elongated, fail to assemble in the normal axonemal '9+2' structure and become motile. Absence of a functional axoneme prevented microgamete assembly and release from the microgametocyte, severely reducing infection of the mosquito vector. This is the first functional study of a kinesin involved in male gametogenesis. These results reveal a previously unknown role for PbKIN8B in male gametogenesis, providing new insights into Plasmodium flagellar formation.\",\n",

Heterologous expression of Plasmodium falciparum genes in Escherichia coli has been a challenge due to their AT-rich codon bias and the highly repetitive DNA sequences. Here, codon harmonization was applied to the malarial antigen, CelTOS (Cell-traversal protein for ookinetes and sporozoites). CelTOS is a highly conserved P. falciparum protein involved in cellular traversal through mosquito and vertebrate host cells. It reversibly refolds after thermal denaturation making it a desirable malarial vaccine candidate. Protein expressed in E. coli from a codon harmonized sequence of P. falciparum CelTOS (CH-PfCelTOS) was compared with protein expressed from the native codon sequence (N-PfCelTOS) to assess the impact of codon usage on protein expression levels, solubility, yield, stability, structural integrity, recognition with CelTOS-specific mAbs and immunogenicity in mice. While the translated proteins were expected to be identical, the translated products produced from the codon-harmonized sequence differed in helical content and showed a smaller distribution of polypeptides in mass spectra indicating lower heterogeneity of the codon harmonized version and fewer amino acid misincorporations. Substitutions of hydrophobic-to-hydrophobic amino acid were observed more commonly than any other.

Our understanding of the molecular events that enable host switching are often limited, and yet this is a fundamentally important question. Plasmodium falciparum, the etiological agent of severe human malaria, evolved following a zoonotic transfer of parasites from gorillas. One gene-rh5-which encodes an essential ligand for the invasion of host erythrocytes, is suspected to have played a critical role in this host switch. Genome comparisons revealed an introgressed sequence in the ancestor of P. falciparum containing rh5, which likely allowed the ancestral parasites to infect both gorilla and human erythrocytes. To test this hypothesis, we resurrected the ancestral introgressed reticulocyte-binding protein homologue 5 (RH5) sequence and used quantitative protein interaction assays to demonstrate that this ancestral protein could bind the basigin receptor from both humans and gorillas. We also showed that this promiscuous receptor binding phenotype of RH5 was shared with the parasite clade that transferred its genome segment to the ancestor of P. falciparum, while the other lineages exhibit host-specific receptor binding, confirming the central importance of this introgression event for Plasmodium host switching. Finally, since its transfer to humans, P. falciparum, and also the RH5 ligand, have evolved a strong human specificity. We show that this subsequent restriction to humans can be attributed to a single amino acid mutation in the RH5 sequence. Our findings reveal a molecular pathway for the origin and evolution of human P. falciparum malaria and may inform molecular surveillance to predict future zoonoses.',\n",

Emergence and spread of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) parasites with decreased susceptibility to ACT in South-East Asia has caused concern worldwide. The current accepted criteria to assess artemisinin (ART) resistance relies upon data on treatment failure, delayed parasite clearance at day 3 (DPC3), parasite clearance half-life (PCHL) and in-vitro/ex-vivo ring stage survival assays (RSAs). Interestingly, some studies suggest that DPC3 does not provide a distinct separation between ART sensitive/resistant strains, and RSA differences may also be inconclusive. More recently, recrudescence of ART treated Pf, independent of the presence of Kelch 13 (K13) mutation (C580Y), has been reported in the monkey malaria model suggesting that genes other than K13 like coronin, dhps, dhfr, crt, mdr1 and plasmepsin1 may contribute towards ACT failure. Here we have collated the distribution of K13 mutants from Pf strains in South Asia. A total of fifty Pf-K13 mutations have been studied for ART resistance in South Asia of which nine have been validated while eleven are potentials for ART resistance. The remaining thirty K13 mutations have been reported from various locations in South Asia but lack corroborative clinical data on ART resistance/ACT failure. Of the fifty, fourteen K13 mutations have been identified in India including four novel mutations (S549Y, G625R, N657H, D702N). Structural mapping of these K13 mutations does not offer any coherent explanation for their contribution towards ART resistance as they are scattered in the K13 structure. Thus, K13 mutations likely provide only a partial synopsis, and we propose that all suspect cases of ACT failure be assessed by: 1) DPC3, 2) PCHL, 3) in-vitro/ex-vivo RSAs and 4) GWAS data in an effort to annotate the resistance status of the parasites. These efforts may help in surveillance and containment of ART resistance/ACT failure in South Asia.',\n",

In-depth profiling of vaccine-induced cytokine, cellular, and antibody responses (\"immunoprofiling\") combined with machine-learning holds the promise of identifying adjuvant-specific immune response characteristics that can guide rational adjuvant selection. Here, we profiled human immune responses induced by vaccines adjuvanted with two similar, clinically relevant adjuvants, AS01B and AS02A, and identified key distinguishing characteristics, or immune signatures, they imprint on vaccine-induced immunity. Samples for this side-by-side comparison were from malaria-naÃ¯ve individuals who had received a recombinant malaria subunit vaccine (AMA-1) that targets the pre-erythrocytic stage of the parasite. Both adjuvant formulations contain the same immunostimulatory components, QS21 and MPL, thus this study reveals the subtle impact that adjuvant formulation has on immunogenicity. Adjuvant-mediated immune signatures were established through a two-step approach: First, we generated a broad immunoprofile (serological, functional and cellular characterization of vaccine-induced responses). Second, we integrated the immunoprofiling data and identify what combination of immune features was most clearly able to distinguish vaccine-induced responses by adjuvant using machine learning. The computational analysis revealed statistically significant differences in cellular and antibody responses between cohorts and identified a combination of immune features that was able to distinguish subjects by adjuvant with 71% accuracy.

This is particularly relevant for P. falciparum, the only known human-infective species of the Laverania sub-genus, all other members of which infect African apes. Here we show that all tested P. falciparum isolates contain an inactivating mutation in an erythrocyte invasion associated gene, PfEBA165, the homologues of which are intact in all ape-infective Laverania species. Recombinant EBA165 proteins only bind ape, not human, erythrocytes, and this specificity is due to differences in erythrocyte surface sialic acids. Correction of PfEBA165 inactivating mutations by genome editing yields viable parasites, but is associated with down regulation of both PfEBA165 and an adjacent invasion ligand, which suggests that PfEBA165 expression is incompatible with parasite growth in human erythrocytes. Pseudogenization of PfEBA165 may represent a key step in the emergence and evolution of P. falciparum.',\n",

However, this approach yielded low performance and stability necessitating development of a more robust model. We hypothesized that by spiking neuron models in simulating the characteristics of a neuron, which when embedded with a BPNN, could improve the performance for the assessment of malaria prone regions. To this end, we created an inter-spike interval (ISI)-based BPNN (ISI-BPNN) architecture that uses a single-pass spiking learning strategy and has a parallel structure that is useful for non-linear regression tasks. Existing malaria dataset comprised of 1296 records, that met these attributes, were used. ISI-BPNN showed superior performance, and a high accuracy. The benchmarking results showed reliability and stability and an improvement of 11.9% against a multilayer perceptron and 9.19% against integrate-and-fire neuron models.

Detail understanding of the PfAMA-1 gene polymorphism can provide useful information on this potential vaccine component.

Polymorphic characteristics and the effect of natural selection were analysed using MEGA 5.0, DnaSP 6.0 and Popart programs. Genetic diversity in 576 global PfAMA-1 DIs were also analysed. Protein function prediction of new amino acid mutation sites was performed using PolyPhen-2 program.\\n131 different haplotypes of PfAMA-1 were identified in 214 Bioko Island P. falciparum isolates. Most amino acid changes identified on Bioko Island were found in C1L. 32 amino acid changes identified in PfAMA-1 sequences from Bioko Island were found in predicted RBC-binding sites, B cell epitopes or IUR regions. Overall patterns of amino acid changes of Bioko PfAMA-1 DIs were similar to those in global PfAMA-1 isolates. Differential amino acid substitution frequencies were observed for samples from different geographical regions. Eight new amino acid changes of Bioko island isolates were also identified and their three-dimensional protein structural consequences were predicted. Evidence for natural selection and recombination event were observed in global isolates.\\nPatterns of nucleotide diversity and amino acid polymorphisms of Bioko Island isolates were similar to those of global PfAMA-1 DIs. Balancing natural selection across DIs might play a major role in generating genetic diversity in global isolates. Most amino acid changes in DIs occurred in predicted B-cell epitopes. Novel sites mapped on a three dimensional structure of PfAMA-1 showed that these regions were located at the corner.

HOP acts as an adapter protein capable of transferring client proteins from the first to the second molecular chaperone. HOP is a modular protein that regulates the ATPase activity of Hsp70 and Hsp90 to perform its function. To obtain more detailed information on the structure and function of this protein, we produced the recombinant HOP of Plasmodium falciparum (PfHOP). The protein was obtained in a folded form, with a high content of Î±-helix secondary structure. Unfolding experiments showed that PfHOP unfolds through two transitions, suggesting the presence of at least two domains with different stabilities. In addition, PfHOP primarily behaved as an elongated dimer in equilibrium with the monomer. Small-angle X-ray scattering data corroborated this interpretation and led to the reconstruction of a PfHOP ab initio model as a dimer. Finally, the PfHOP protein was able to inhibit and to stimulate the ATPase activity of the recombinant Hsp90 and Hsp70-1, respectively, of P. falciparum. Our results deepened the knowledge of the structure and function of PfHOP and further clarified its participation in the P. falciparum foldosome.',\n",

Currently, the most advanced vaccine, known as RTS,S, has only shown modest efficacy in clinical trials. Thus, the development of more efficacious vaccines by improving the formulation of RTS,S for increased efficacy or to interrupt malaria transmission are urgently needed. The RTS,S vaccine is based on the presentation of a fragment of the sporozoite antigen on the surface of virus-like particles (VLPs) based on human hepatitis B virus (HBV). In this study, we have developed and evaluated a novel VLP platform based on duck HBV (known as Metavax) for malaria vaccine development. This platform can incorporate large and complex proteins into VLPs and is produced in a Hansenula cell line compatible with cGMP vaccine production. Here, we have established the expression of leading P. falciparum malaria vaccine candidates as VLPs. This includes Pfs230 and Pfs25, which are candidate transmission-blocking vaccine antigens. We demonstrated that the VLPs effectively induce antibodies to malaria vaccine candidates with minimal induction of antibodies to the duck-HBV scaffold antigen. Antibodies to Pfs230 also recognised native protein on the surface of gametocytes, and antibodies to both Pfs230 and Pfs25 demonstrated transmission-reducing activity in standard membrane feeding assays. These results establish the potential utility of this VLP platform for malaria vaccines, which may be suitable for the development of multi-component vaccines that achieve high vaccine efficacy and transmission-blocking immunity.',\n",

Host-parasite protein interaction enhances the understanding of how parasite can infect its host. The interaction plays an important role in initiating infections, although it is not all host-parasite interactions that result in infection. Identifying the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that allow a parasite to infect its host has a lot do in discovering possible drug targets. Such PPIs, when altered, would prevent the host from being infected by the parasite and in some cases, result in the parasite inability to complete specific stages of its life cycle and invariably lead to the death of such parasite. It therefore becomes important to understand the workings of host-parasite interactions which are the major causes of most infectious diseases.\\nMany studies have been conducted in literature to predict HPPI, mostly using computational methods with few experimental methods. Computational method has proved to be faster and more efficient in manipulating and analyzing real life data. This study looks at various computational methods used in literature for host-parasite/inter-species protein-protein interaction predictions with the hope of getting a better insight into computational methods used and identify whether machine learning approaches have been extensively used for the same purpose.\\nThe various methods involved in host-parasite protein interactions were reviewed with their individual strengths. Tabulations of studies that carried out host-parasite/inter-species protein interaction predictions were performed, analyzing their predictive methods, filters used, potential protein-protein interactions discovered in those studies and various validation measurements used as the case may be.

The isolation and characterization of CTCs could provide a non-invasive method for repeated analysis of the mutational and phenotypic state of the tumor during the course of disease. However, the efficient detection of glioma CTCs has proven to be challenging due to the lack of consistently expressed tumor markers and high inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity. Thus, for this field to progress, an omnipresent but specific marker of glioma CTCs is required. In this article, we demonstrate how the recombinant malaria VAR2CSA protein (rVAR2) can be used for the capture and detection of glioma cell lines that are spiked into blood through binding to a cancer-specific oncofetal chondroitin sulfate (ofCS). When using rVAR2 pull-down from glioma cells, we identified a panel of proteoglycans, known to be essential for glioma progression. Finally, the clinical feasibility of this work is supported by the rVAR2-based isolation and detection of CTCs from glioma patient blood samples, which highlights ofCS as a potential clinical target for CTC isolation.',\n",

This article highlights for the first time detailed structural analysis of PFA0660w-PfHsp70-x chaperone pair to better understand their binding mechanism. Here, we have modeled reliable molecular structures for the complete conserved region of PFA0660w and PfHsp70-x. These structures were evaluated by different structure verification tools followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The model of PFA0660w was subjected to docking with PfHsp70-x using Haddock to reveal a number of residues crucial for their bipartite interaction, and also performed MD simulations on the complex. The peptide binding clefts of PFA0660w and its other Plasmodium species homologs were found to be bigger than their counterparts in higher eukaryotes like yeast, humans and C. parvum. Based on our results, we propose a model for PFA0660w-PfHsp70-x interaction and a mechanism of substrate binding, and compare it with its dimeric human counterparts. Owing to these striking structural differences between the host and parasite chaperones, such information on the essential Hsp40 and its partner Hsp70 may form the basis for rational drug design against fatal malaria.\",\n",

Macaques are natural hosts for this parasite, but little is conclusively known about its patterns of transmission within and between these hosts. Here, we apply a comprehensive phylogenetic approach to test for patterns of cryptic population genetic structure between P. knowlesi isolated from humans and long-tailed macaques from the state of Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo. Our approach differs from previous investigations through our exhaustive use of archival 18S Small Subunit rRNA (18S) gene sequences from Plasmodium and Hepatocystis species, our inclusion of insertion and deletion information during phylogenetic inference, and our application of Bayesian phylogenetic inference to this problem. We report distinct clades of P. knowlesi that predominantly contained sequences from either human or macaque hosts for paralogous A-type and S-type 18S gene loci. We report significant partitioning of sequence distances between host species across both types of loci, and confirmed that sequences of the same locus type showed significantly biased assortment into different clades depending on their host species. Our results support the zoonotic potential of Plasmodium knowlesi, but also suggest that humans may be preferentially infected with certain strains of this parasite. Broadly, such patterns could arise through preferential zoonotic transmission of some parasite lineages or a disposition of parasites to transmit within, rather than between, human and macaque hosts. Available data are insufficient to address these hypotheses. Our results suggest that the epidemiology of P. knowlesi may be more complicated than previously assumed, and highlight the need for renewed and more vigorous explorations of transmission patterns in the fifth human malarial parasite.',\n",

Here, we tested for the roles of host and parasite evolutionary history as well as environmental variables as drivers of phylogenetic community structure among co-infecting haemosporidian (malaria) parasites and their avian hosts in the North American boreal forest, a region characterized by an extraordinarily high blood parasite co-infection rate. We used multiple methods to identify non-random patterns of co-infection among parasite species and determined whether these patterns were influenced more by co-evolutionary host associations or environmental variables. We used model-based approaches to test whether parasites that occurred together in a single host individual exhibited phylogenetic clustering or overdispersion. Lastly, we tested whether the observed phylogenetic community structure could be explained by parasites having convergently evolved similar patterns of host associations. We found that haemosporidian parasite co-infections occurred at a high frequency in the boreal forest system and that parasite taxa co-occurred in significantly non-random patterns within host individuals and among host species. Parasite taxa that occurred in co-infections tended to be phylogenetically overdispersed. We show that this pattern of phylogenetic overdispersion can be attributed largely to the effect of evolutionarily labile, convergent host associations that have resulted in the pool of parasites that have the potential to infect a given host consisting nearly exclusively of distantly related lineages. Our findings illustrate that environmental filtering of convergent traits can produce phylogenetically overdispersed communities, even at the level of co-infecting parasites within an individual host organism. Broadly, this analysis illustrates how co-evolutionary history can have a strong influence on the modern phylogenetic community assembly of diverse host-symbiont communities.',\n",

       " '31402116': 'Uracil is not always a mistakenly occurring base in DNA. Uracils in DNA genomes are known to be important in the life cycles of Bacillus subtilis phages (PBS1/2) and the malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum; and have been implicated in the development of fruit fly and antibody maturation in B-lymphocytes. Availability of a sensitive, specific and robust technique for the detection uracils in genes/genomes is essential to understand its varied biological roles. Mycobacterium smegmatis UdgX (MsmUdgX), identified and characterised in our laboratory, forms covalent complexes with the uracil sites in DNA in a specific manner. MsmUdgX cleaves the glycosidic bond between uracil and the deoxyribose sugar in DNA to produce uracilate and oxocarbenium ions. The oxocarbenium ion is then captured into a covalent complex by the nucleophilic attack of a histidine side chain of MsmUdgX. Here, we describe the use of a fusion protein, mCherry tagged MsmUdgX (mChUdgX), which combines the property of MsmUdgX to covalently and specifically bind the uracil sites in the genome, with the sensitivity of fluorescent detection of mCherry as a reporter. We show that both the purified mChUdgX and the Escherichia coli cell-extracts overexpressing mChUdgX provide high sensitivity and specificity of detecting uracils in DNA.',\n",
       " '31396604': 'With the emergence of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, the treatment of malaria has become a significant challenge; therefore, the development of antimalarial drugs acting on new targets is extremely urgent. In Plasmodium falciparum, type II nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase (NDH-2) is responsible for catalyzing the transfer of two electrons from NADH to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which in turn transfers the electrons to coenzyme Q (CoQ). As an entry enzyme for oxidative phosphorylation, NDH-2 has become one of the popular targets for the development of new antimalarial drugs. In this study, reliable motion trajectories of the NDH-2 complex with its co-factors (NADH and FAD) and inhibitor, RYL-552, were obtained by comparative molecular dynamics simulations. The influence of cofactor binding on the global motion of NDH-2 was explored through conformational clustering, principal component analysis and free energy landscape. The molecular interactions of NDH-2 before and after its binding with the inhibitor RYL-552 were analyzed, and the key residues and important hydrogen bonds were also determined. The results show that the association of RYL-552 results in the weakening of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and large allosterism of NDH-2. There was a significant positive correlation between the angular change of the key pocket residues in the NADH-FAD-pockets that represents the global functional motion and the change in distance between NADH-C4 and FAD-N5 that represents the electron transfer efficiency. Finally, the possible non-competitive inhibitory mechanism of RYL-552 was proposed. Specifically, the association of inhibitors with NDH-2 significantly affects the global motion mode of NDH-2, leading to widening of the distance between NADH and FAD through cooperative motion induction; this reduces the electron transfer efficiency of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The simulation results provide useful theoretical guidance for subsequent antimalarial drug design based on the NDH-2 structure and the respiratory chain electron transfer mechanism.',\n",

A new chemotherapeutic compound is needed for malarial therapy. Antimalarial activity against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant P. falciparum has been reported for an isocryptolepine derivative, 8-bromo-2-fluoro-5-methyl-5H-indolo[3,2-c]quinoline (ICL-M), which also showed less toxicity to human cells. ICL-M has indoloquinoline as a core structure and its mode of action remains unclear. Here, we explored the mechanisms of ICL-M in P. falciparum by assessing the stage-specific activity, time-dependent effect, a proteomic analysis and morphology. Since human topo II activity inhibition has been reported as a function of isocryptolepine derivatives, malarial topo II activity inhibition of ICL-M was also examined in this study. The ICL-M exhibited antimalarial activity against both the ring and trophozoite stages of P. falciparum. Our proteomics analysis revealed that a total of 112 P. falciparum proteins were differentially expressed after ICL-M exposure; among these, 58 and 54 proteins were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Proteins localized in the food vacuole, nucleus, and cytoplasm showed quantitative alterations after ICL-M treatment. A bioinformatic analysis revealed that pathways associated with ribosomes, proteasomes, metabolic pathways, amino acid biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and carbon metabolism were significantly different in P. falciparum treated with ICL-M. Moreover, a loss of ribosomes was clearly observed by transmission electron microscopy in the ICL-M-treated P. falciparum. This finding is in agreement with the proteomics data, which revealed downregulated levels of ribosomal proteins following ICL-M treatment. Our results provide important information about the mechanisms by which ICL-M affects the malaria parasite, which may facilitate the drug development of isocryptolepine derivatives.',\n",

Vaccine efficacy has been hindered by existing sequence diversity in proteins and by newly-acquired mutations that enable escape from vaccine-induced immune responses. To address these limitations, we developed an approach for nanopatterning protein antigens that combines the site-specific incorporation of non-canonical amino acids with chemical modification to focus the immune response on conserved protein regions. We demonstrated the approach using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a model antigen and with a promising malaria vaccine candidate, Merozoite surface protein 119 (MSP119). Immunization of mice with nanopatterned MSP119 elicited antibodies that recognized MSP119 from heterologous strains, differing in sequence at as many as 21 of 96 residues. Nanopatterning should enable the elicitation of broadly protective antibodies against a wide range of pathogens and toxins.',\n",

The PA28 regulator stimulates 20S proteasome peptidase activity in vitro, but its role in vivo remains unclear. Here, we show that genetic deletion of the PA28 regulator from Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) renders malaria parasites more sensitive to the antimalarial drug dihydroartemisinin, indicating that PA28 may play a role in protection against proteotoxic stress. The crystal structure of PfPA28 reveals a bell-shaped molecule with an inner pore that has a strong segregation of charges. Small-angle X-ray scattering shows that disordered loops, which are not resolved in the crystal structure, extend from the PfPA28 heptamer and surround the pore. Using single particle cryo-electron microscopy, we solved the structure of Pf20S in complex with one and two regulatory PfPA28 caps at resolutions of 3.9 and 3.8\\u2009Ã, respectively. PfPA28 binds Pf20S asymmetrically, strongly engaging subunits on only one side of the core. PfPA28 undergoes rigid body motions relative to Pf20S.

We propose lateral transfer of short peptides through the dynamic interface as a mechanism facilitating the release of proteasome degradation products.',\n",

The study was performed in rabbits, which were immunized with FVO-AMA1 in combination with one of the seven adjuvants.

Thus, in this study the ideal adjuvant is expected to induce high functional antibody levels, a long-lived response, and a broad cross-strain activity.\\nAMA1 formulated in all adjuvants was immunogenic. However, the magnitude of the immune responses differed between the seven adjuvants. The highest IgG levels were observed for the CoVaccine HTâ¢ group, this was statistically significant for all four AMA1 variants versus all other adjuvant groups. No differences were observed in the breadth of the humoral response, i.e., increased recognition of AMA1 variants. Also, Growth Inhibition Activity (GIA) for both Plasmodium falciparum strains (FCR3 - homologous to FVO AMA1 protein and NF54 - heterologous to FVO AMA1 protein) were significantly higher in the CoVaccine HTâ¢ group as compared to the other adjuvant groups.\\nIn brief, all seven vaccine - adjuvant formulations were immunogenic. The magnitude of the immune responses differed between the seven adjuvants. No statistically significant differences were observed in the breadth of the humoral response, nor in longevity of the response.

Three fragments derived from the 2 family-specific and constant regions of merozoite surface protein (MSP2) and PFF0165c protein were previously selected for evaluation as potential single vaccine candidates. In order to increase and optimize their potential efficacy against P. falciparum infection the 3 antigens were combined in a single DNA recombinant product (FusN) and compared its antigenicity with that of single antigens in sera of volunteers living in endemic countries. Immunogenicity of the FusN was then compared with that of the mixture of 3 antigens in 3 strains of mice. Antigen specific, affinity purified human antibodies were then tested in antibody dependent cellular inhibition and merozoite opsonization assays. In addition, the antigen specific antibody response and its association with protection from malaria infection were determined. The data collected indicate that the recombinant product is an equal or better antigen /immunogen than fragments used either alone or as a mixture for vaccination in combination with adjuvant. In addition, antibody response to FusN shows a stronger association with protection than single fragments. The use of a single construct as vaccine would drastically reduce the cost of manufacturing and development of the GMP product.',\n",
       " '31356937': \"Several exported Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) proteins contribute to malaria biology through their involvement in cytoadherence, immune evasion and host cell remodelling. Many of these exported proteins and other host molecules are present in iRBC (infected red blood cell) generated extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are responsible for host cell modification and parasite development. CX3CL1 binding proteins (CBPs) present on the surface of iRBCs have been reported to contribute to cytoadhesion by binding with the chemokine 'CX3CL1' via their extracellular domains. Here, we have characterized the cytoplasmic domain of CBP2 to understand its function in parasite biology using biochemical and biophysical methods. Recombinant cytoplasmic CBP2 (cCBP2) binds nucleic acids showing interaction with DNA/RNA. cCBP2 shows dimer formation under non-reducing conditions highlighting the role of disulphide bonds in its oligomerization while ATP binding leads to structural changes in the protein. In vitro interaction studies depict its binding with a Maurer's cleft resident protein 'PfSBP1', which is influenced by ATP binding of cCBP2. Our results suggest CBP2 as a two-transmembrane (2TM) receptor responsible for targeting EVs and delivering cargo to host endothelial cells. We propose CBP2 as an important molecule having roles in cytoadherence and immune modulation through its extracellular and cytoplasmic domains respectively.\",\n",

Around 30% of malaria infections in Ecuador are caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Most malaria population genetics studies performed in Latin America, especially in the Pacific Coast, indicate a high clonality and a clear structure of P. falciparum populations. It was shown that an outbreak of P. falciparum in northwest Ecuador was the result of a clonal expansion of parasites circulating at low levels in the country or re-invading Ecuador from neighbouring territories. However, general characteristics of P. falciparum circulating in the northwest coast of Ecuador have not been determined. The main goal of this study was to genetically characterize the population structure of P. falciparum in coastal Ecuadorian localities bordering with Colombia.\\nMolecular investigation of 41 samples collected from 2013 to 2016 in San Lorenzo County, northwest Ecuador was performed using seven neutral microsatellite markers.\\nThe genetic population structure of P. falciparum in northwest Ecuador is clearly defined as three different genetic groups previously reported in Ecuador, Peru and Colombia.\\nThe limited number of P. falciparum clonal types that are circulating in northwest Ecuador, are related to ancestral parasite clonal lineages reported in the Pacific Coast. These parasites could be a product of migration from neighbouring regions or residual clonal types circulating in the country in low proportions. Studies of the genetic characterization of P. falciparum in eliminating areas help determine the possible origin of parasites in order to create strategies to prevent the entrance of new lineages and achieve local elimination of malaria.',\n",

In this work, we report the molecular and functional characterization of Gametocyte EXported Protein 15 (GEXP15), a Plasmodium specific protein, as a regulator of PP1. In vitro interaction studies demonstrated that GEXP15 physically interacts with PP1 through the RVxF binding motif in P. berghei. Functional assays showed that GEXP15 was able to increase PP1 activity and the mutation of the RVxF motif completely abolished this regulation. Immunoprecipitation assays of tagged GEXP15 or PP1 in P. berghei followed by immunoblot or mass spectrometry analyses confirmed their interaction and showed that they are present both in schizont and gametocyte stages in shared protein complexes involved in the spliceosome and proteasome pathways and known to play essential role in parasite development. Phenotypic analysis of viable GEXP15 deficient P. berghei blood parasites showed that they were unable to develop lethal infection in BALB/c mice or to establish experimental cerebral malaria in C57BL/6 mice. Further, although deficient parasites produced gametocytes they did not produce any oocysts/sporozoites indicating a high fitness cost in the mosquito. Global proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of GEXP15 deficient schizonts revealed a profound defect with a significant decrease in the abundance and an impact on phosphorylation status of proteins involved in regulation of gene expression or invasion. Moreover, depletion of GEXP15 seemed to impact mainly the abundance of some specific proteins of female gametocytes. Our study provides the first insight into the contribution of a PP1 regulator to Plasmodium virulence and suggests that GEXP15 affects both the asexual and sexual life cycle.',\n",
       " '31347248': 'Plasmodium falciparum is the most lethal species of malaria. In infected human red blood cells, P. falciparum digests hemoglobin as a nutrient source, liberating cytotoxic free heme in the process. Sequestration and subsequent conversion of this byproduct into hemozoin, an inert biocrystalline heme aggregate, plays a key role in parasite survival. Hemozoin has been a longstanding target of antimalarials such as chloroquine (CQ), which inhibit the biocrystallization of free heme. In this study, we explore heme-binding interactions with histidine-rich-protein 2 (HRP2), a known malarial biomarker and purported player in free heme sequestration. HRP2 is notoriously challenging to target due to its highly repetitious sequence and irregular secondary structure. We started with three protein-catalyzed capture agents (PCCs) developed against epitopes of HRP2, inclusive of heme-binding motifs, and explored their ability to inhibit heme:HRP2 complex formation. Cocktails of the individual PCCs exhibit an inhibitory potency similar to CQ, while a covalently linked structure built from two separate PCCs provided considerably increased inhibition relative to CQ. Epitope-targeted disruption of heme:HRP2 binding is a novel approach towards disrupting P. falciparum-related hemozoin formation.',\n",

Humans can host the parasite for years without presenting significant symptoms, turning its diagnosis and control into a difficult task. Here, we investigated the immunogenicity of recombinant proteins of P. malariae MSP1.\\nFive regions of PmMSP1 were expressed in Escherichia coli as GST-fusion proteins and immunized in BALB/c mice. The specificity, subtyping, and affinity of raised antibodies were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Cellular immune responses were analyzed by lymphoproliferation assays and cytokine levels produced by splenocytes were detected by cytometry.\\nWe found that N-terminal, central regions, and PmMSP119 are strongly immunogenic in mice. After three doses, the induced immune responses remained high for 70 days. While antibodies induced after immunization with N-terminal and central regions showed similar affinities to the target antigens, affinities of IgG against PmMSP119 were higher. All proteins induced similar antibody subclass patterns (predominantly IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b), characterizing a mixed Th1/Th2 response. Further, autologous stimulation of splenocytes from immunized mice led to the secretion of IL2 and IL4, independently of the antigen used. Importantly, IgG from P. malariae-exposed individuals reacted against PmMSP1 recombinant proteins with a high specificity. On the other hand, sera from P. vivax or P. falciparum-infected individuals did not react at all against recombinant PmMSP1 proteins.\\nRecombinant PmMSP1 proteins are very useful diagnostic markers of P. malariae in epidemiological studies or in the differential diagnosis of malaria caused by this species. Immunization with recombinant PmMSP1 proteins resulted in a significant humoral immune response, which may turn them potential component candidates for a vaccine against P. malariae.',\n",

K13 is an essential protein that contains BTB and Kelch-repeat propeller (KREP) domains usually found in E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes that target substrate protein(s) for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. K13 is thought to bind substrate proteins, but its functional/interaction sites and the structural alterations associated with artemisinin resistance mutations remain unknown. Here, we screened for the most evolutionarily conserved sites in the protein structure of K13 as indicators of structural and/or functional constraints. We inferred structure-dependent substitution rates at each amino acid site of the highly conserved K13 protein during the evolution of Apicomplexa parasites. We found two solvent-exposed patches of extraordinarily conserved sites likely involved in protein-protein interactions, one in BTB and the other one in KREP. The conserved patch in K13 KREP overlaps with a shallow pocket that displays a differential electrostatic surface potential, relative to neighboring sites, and that is rich in serine and arginine residues. Comparative structural and evolutionary analyses revealed that these properties were also found in the functionally-validated\\xa0shallow pocket of other\\xa0KREPs including that of the cancer-related KEAP1 protein. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations carried out on PfK13 R539T and C580Y artemisinin resistance mutant structures revealed some local structural destabilization of KREP but not in its shallow pocket. These findings open new avenues of research on one of the most enigmatic malaria proteins with the utmost clinical importance.',\n",

Understanding the genetic diversity of the genes, pfmsp-1 and pfmsp-2, is important for recognizing the genetic structure of P. falciparum, and the development of an effective vaccine based on the antigens. In this study, the genetic diversities of pfmsp-1 and pfmsp-2 in the Myanmar P. falciparum were analysed.\\nThe pfmsp-1 block 2 and pfmsp-2 block 3 regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from blood samples collected from Myanmar patients who were infected with P. falciparum in 2013-2015. The amplified gene fragments were cloned into a T&A vector, and sequenced. Sequence analysis of Myanmar pfmsp-1 block 2 and pfmsp-2 block 3 was performed to identify the genetic diversity of the regions. The temporal genetic changes of both pfmsp-1 and pfmsp-2 in the Myanmar P. falciparum population, as well as the polymorphic diversity in the publicly available global pfmsp-1 and pfmsp-2, were also comparatively analysed.\\nHigh levels of genetic diversity of pfmsp-1 and pfmsp-2 were observed in the Myanmar P. falciparum isolates. Twenty-eight different alleles of pfmsp-1 (8 for K1 type, 14 for MAD20 type, and 6 for RO33 type) and 59 distinct alleles of pfmsp-2 (18 for FC27, and 41 for 3D7 type) were identified in the Myanmar P. falciparum population in amino acid level. Comparative analyses of the genetic diversity of the Myanmar pfmsp-1 and pfmsp-2 alleles in the recent (2013-2015) and past (2004-2006) Myanmar P. falciparum populations indicated the dynamic genetic expansion of the pfmsp-1 and pfmsp-2 in recent years, suggesting that a high level of genetic differentiation and recombination of the two genes may be maintained. Population genetic structure analysis of the global pfmsp-1 and pfmsp-2 also suggested that a high level of genetic diversity of the two genes was found in the global P. falciparum population.\\nDespite the recent remarkable decline of malaria cases, the Myanmar P. falciparum population still remains of sufficient size to allow the generation and maintenance of genetic diversity. The high level of genetic diversity of pfmsp-1 and pfmsp-2 in the global P. falciparum population emphasizes the necessity for continuous monitoring of the genetic diversity of the genes for better understanding of the genetic make-up and evolutionary aspect of the genes in the global P. falciparum population.',\n",

Genetic analysis has shown that the parasites are divided into three subpopulations according to their geographic origin (Peninsular or Borneo) and, in Borneo, their macaque host (Macaca fascicularis or M. nemestrina). Whilst evidence suggests that genetic exchange events have occurred between the two Borneo subpopulations, the picture is unclear in less studied Peninsular strains. One difficulty is that P. knowlesi infected individuals tend to present with low parasitaemia leading to samples with insufficient DNA for whole genome sequencing. Here, using a parasite selective whole genome amplification approach on unprocessed blood samples, we were able to analyse recent genomes sourced from both Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo. The analysis provides evidence that recombination events are present in the Peninsular Malaysia parasite subpopulation, which have acquired fragments of the M. nemestrina associated subpopulation genotype, including the DBPÎ² and NBPXa erythrocyte invasion genes.

Hsp70 is central to cellular proteostasis and some of its isoforms are essential for survival of the malaria parasite. In addition, they are also implicated in the development of antimalarial drug resistance. For these reasons, they are thought to be potential drug targets, especially in antimalarial combination therapies. However, their high sequence conservation across species presents a hurdle with respect to their selective targeting. The human genome encodes 17 Hsp70 isoforms while P. falciparum encodes for only 6. The structural architecture of Hsp70s is typically characterized by a highly conserved N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a less conserved C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD). The two domains are connected by a highly conserved linker. In spite of their fairly high sequence conservation, Hsp70s from various species possess unique signature motifs that appear to uniquely influence their function. In addition, their cooperation with co-chaperones further regulates their functional specificity. In the current review, bioinformatics tools were used to identify conserved and unique signature motifs in Hsp70s of P. falciparum versus their human counterparts. We discuss the common and distinctive structure-function features of these proteins. This information is important towards elucidating the prospects of selective targeting of parasite heat shock proteins as part of antimalarial design efforts.',\n",

Unlike children, adults recognize a broad range of variant surface antigens (VSAs) and are protected from severe disease. Though crucial to the design and feasibility of an effective malaria vaccine, it is not yet known whether immunity arises through cumulative exposure to each of many antigenic types, cross-reactivity between antigenic types, or some other mechanism. In this study, we measured plasma antibody responses of 36 children with symptomatic malaria to a diverse panel of 36 recombinant proteins comprising part of the DBLÎ± domain (the 'DBLÎ±-tag') of PfEMP1, a major class of VSAs. We found that although plasma antibody responses were highly specific to individual antigens, serological profiles of responses across antigens fell into one of just two distinct types. One type was found almost exclusively in children that succumbed to severe disease (19 out of 20) while the other occurred in all children with mild disease (16 out of 16). Moreover, children with severe malaria had serological profiles that were narrower in antigen specificity and shorter-lived than those in children with mild malaria. Borrowing a novel technique used in influenza-antigenic cartography-we mapped these dichotomous serological profiles to amino acid sequence variation within a small sub-region of the PfEMP1 DBLÎ± domain. By applying our methodology on a larger scale, it should be possible to identify epitopes responsible for eliciting the protective version of serological profiles to PfEMP1 thereby accelerating development of a broadly effective anti-disease malaria vaccine.\",\n",

In humans, there are four glycophorins: A, B, C and D. Glycophorins play an important role in the invasion of red blood cells (RBCs) by malaria parasites, which involves several ligands binding to RBC receptors. Four Plasmodium falciparum merozoite EBL ligands have been identified: erythrocyte-binding antigen-175 (EBA-175), erythrocyte-binding antigen-181 (EBA-181), erythrocyte-binding ligand-1 (EBL-1) and erythrocyte-binding antigen-140 (EBA-140). It is generally accepted that glycophorin A (GPA) is the receptor for P. falciparum EBA-175 ligand. It has been shown that Î±(2,3) sialic acid residues of GPA O-glycans form conformation-dependent clusters on GPA polypeptide chain which facilitate binding. P. falciparum can also invade erythrocytes using glycophorin B (GPB), which is structurally similar to GPA. It has been shown that P. falciparum EBL-1 ligand binds to GPB. Interestingly, a hybrid GPB-GPA molecule called Dantu is associated with a reduced risk of severe malaria and ameliorates malaria-related morbidity. Glycophorin C (GPC) is a receptor for P. falciparum EBA-140 ligand. Likewise, successful binding of EBA-140 depends on sialic acid residues of N- and O-linked oligosaccharides of GPC, which form a cluster or a conformational structure depending on the presence of peptide fragment encompassing amino acids (aa) 36-63. Evaluation of the homologous P. reichenowi EBA-140 unexpectedly revealed that the chimpanzee homolog of human glycophorin D (GPD) is probably the receptor for this ligand. In this review, we concentrate on the role of glycophorins as erythrocyte receptors for Plasmodium parasites. The presented data support the long-lasting idea of high evolutionary pressure exerted by Plasmodium on the human glycophorins, which emerge as important receptors for these parasites.',\n",

The resulting frequency-dependent selection can structure parasite populations into strains of limited genetic overlap. For the causative agent of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, the high recombination rates and associated vast diversity of its highly antigenic and multicopy var genes preclude such clear clustering in endemic regions. This undermines the definition of strains as specific, temporally persisting gene variant combinations. We use temporal multilayer networks to analyze the genetic similarity of parasites in both simulated data and in an extensively and longitudinally sampled population in Ghana. When viewed over time, populations are structured into modules (i.e., groups) of parasite genomes whose var gene combinations are more similar within than between the modules and whose persistence is much longer than that of the individual genomes that compose them. Comparison to neutral models that retain parasite population dynamics but lack competition reveals that the selection imposed by host immunity promotes the persistence of these modules. The modular structure is, in turn, associated with a slower acquisition of immunity by individual hosts. Modules thus represent dynamically generated niches in host immune space, which can be interpreted as strains. Negative frequency-dependent selection therefore shapes the organization of the var diversity into parasite genomes, leaving a persistence signature over ecological time scales. Multilayer networks extend the scope of phylodynamics analyses by allowing quantification of temporal genetic structure in organisms that generate variation via recombination or other non-bifurcating processes. A strain structure similar to the one described here should apply to other pathogens with large antigenic spaces that evolve via recombination. For malaria, the temporal modular structure should enable the formulation of tractable epidemiological models that account for parasite antigenic diversity and its influence on intervention outcomes.',\n",

Along with classical gene regulation by transcription factors (TFs), of which only one family, the AP2 TFs, has been described in the parasite genome, a large body of evidence points toward chromatin structure and epigenetic factors mediating the changes in gene expression associated with parasite life cycle stages. These attributes may be critically important for immune evasion, host cell invasion and development of the parasite in its two hosts, the human and the Anopheles vector. Thus, the factors involved in the maintenance and regulation of chromatin and epigenetic features represent potential targets for antimalarial drugs. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms in P. falciparum that regulate chromatin structure, nucleosome landscape, the 3-dimensional structure of the genome and additional distinctive features created by parasite-specific genes and gene families. We review conserved traits of chromatin in eukaryotes in order to highlight what is unique in the parasite.',\n",

Here, we investigated the effect of phosphorylation of variant surface antigen 2-CSA (VAR2CSA), a member of the PfEMP1 family associated to placental sequestration, on its capacity to adhere to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) present on the placental syncytium. We showed that phosphatase treatment of IEs impairs cytoadhesion to CSA.

Site-directed mutagenesis on recombinant VAR2CSA of 3 phosphoresidues localised within the CSA-binding region confirmed in vitro their functional importance. Furthermore, using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (CRISPR/Cas9), we generated a parasite line in which the phosphoresidue T934 is changed to alanine and showed that this mutation strongly impairs IEs cytoadhesion to CSA.

In the case of haemosporidian blood parasites, epidemic wild bird mortalities on oceanic islands have been linked to Plasmodium spp., but not genera like Haemoproteus. Indeed, Haemoproteus is absent from many oceanic islands. By contrast, birds on continental islands share long coevolutionary histories with both Plasmodium and Haemoproteus, and are thus ideal model systems to elucidate eco-evolutionary endpoints associated with these parasites in oceanic islands. Here, we examine eco-evolutionary dynamics of avian haemosporidian in the Shola sky-island archipelago of the Western Ghats, India. Our analyses reveal that compared to Plasmodium, Haemoproteus lineages were highly host-specific and diversified via co-speciation with their hosts. We show that community structure of host-generalist Plasmodium was primarily driven by geographical factors (e.g. biogeographic barriers), while that of host-specialist Haemoproteus was driven by host species barriers (e.g. phylogenetic distance). Consequently, a few host species can harbour a high diversity of Plasmodium lineages which, in turn, are capable of infecting multiple host species. These two mechanisms can act in concert to increase the risk of introduction, establishment, and emergence of novel Plasmodium lineages in island systems.',\n",

Eight putative pseudokinases have been predicted in Plasmodium species. We selected the unique pseudokinase belonging to tyrosine kinase like (TKL) family for detailed structural and functional analysis in P. falciparum and P. berghei. The primary structure of PfpTKL lacks residues critical for kinase activity, supporting its annotation as a pseudokinase. The recombinant pTKL pseudokinase domain was able to bind ATP, but lacked catalytic activity as predicted. The sterile alpha motif (SAM) and RVxF motifs of PfpTKL were found to interact with the P. falciparum proteins serine repeat antigen 5 (SERA5) and protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1) respectively, suggesting that pTKL has a scaffolding role. Furthermore, we found that PP1c activity in a heterologous model was modulated in an RVxF-dependent manner. During the trophozoite stages, PbpTKL was exported to infected erythrocytes where it formed complexes with proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization or host cell maturation and homeostasis.

Here, we isolated a panel of monoclonal antibodies from human volunteers immunized in a clinical vaccine trial of PvDBP. We screened their ability to prevent PvDBP from binding to the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines, and their capacity to block red blood cell invasion by a transgenic Plasmodium knowlesi parasite genetically modified to express PvDBP and to prevent reticulocyte invasion by multiple clinical isolates of P. vivax. This identified a broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibody that inhibited invasion of all tested strains of P. vivax.

Hence, the enzymes AMP deaminase (AMPD) and nucleotidases, which catabolize AMP, indirectly regulate AK activity and in-turn affect AEC.

Similarities and differences between Plasmodium falciparum AMPD (PfAMPD) and its homologs from yeast, Arabidopsis and humans are also discussed. The AMPD gene was deleted in the murine malaria parasite P. berghei and was found to be dispensable during all stages of the parasite life cycle. However, when episomal expression was attempted, viable parasites were not obtained, suggesting that perturbing AMP homeostasis by over-expressing AMPD might be lethal.

In this work we developed correlative STochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy-Scanning Electron Microscopy (STORM-SEM) to spatially and temporally map the delivery of the knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP) and PfEMP1 to the RBC membrane skeleton. We show that KAHRP is delivered as individual modules that assemble in situ, giving a ring-shaped fluorescence profile around a dimpled disk that can be visualized by SEM. Electron tomography of negatively-stained membranes reveals a previously observed spiral scaffold underpinning the assembled knobs. Truncation of the C-terminal region of KAHRP leads to loss of the ring structures, disruption of the raised disks and aberrant formation of the spiral scaffold, pointing to a critical role for KAHRP in assembling the physical knob structure. We show that host cell actin remodeling plays an important role in assembly of the virulence complex, with cytochalasin D blocking knob assembly.

Taking advantage of emerging insight into structure/function relationships in homologous facilitative hexose transporters and our novel high throughput screening platform, we investigated the ability of compounds satisfying Lipinksi rules for drug likeness to directly interact and inhibit PfHT. The Maybridge HitFinder chemical library was interrogated by searching for compounds that reduce intracellular glucose by >40% at 10 Î¼M. Testing of initial hits via measurement of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake in PfHT over-expressing cell lines identified 6 structurally unique glucose transport inhibitors. WU-1 (3-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-methyl-N-[2-(4-methylbenzenesulfonyl)ethyl]-1,2-oxazole-4-carboxamide) blocked 2-DG uptake (IC50 = 5.8 Â± 0.6 Î¼M) with minimal effect on the human orthologue class I (GLUTs 1-4), class II (GLUT8) and class III (GLUT5) facilitative glucose transporters. WU-1 showed comparable potency in blocking 2-DG uptake in freed parasites and inhibiting parasite growth, with an IC50 of 6.1 Â± 0.8 Î¼M and EC50 of 5.5 Â± 0.6 Î¼M, respectively. WU-1 also directly competed for N-[2-[2-[2-[(N-biotinylcaproylamino)ethoxy)ethoxyl]-4-[2-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl]benzoyl]-1,3-bis(mannopyranosyl-4-yloxy)-2-propylamine (ATB-BMPA) binding and inhibited the transport of D-glucose with an IC50 of 5.9 Â± 0.8 Î¼M in liposomes containing purified PfHT. Kinetic analysis revealed that WU-1 acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of zero-trans D-fructose uptake. Decreased potency for WU-1 and the known endofacial ligand cytochalasin B was observed when PfHT was engineered to contain an N-terminal FLAG tag. This modification resulted in a concomitant increase in affinity for 4,6-O-ethylidene-Î±-D-glucose, an exofacially directed transport antagonist, but did not alter the Km for 2-DG. Taken together, these data are consistent with a model in which WU-1 binds preferentially to the transporter in an inward open conformation and support the feasibility of developing potent and selective PfHT antagonists as a novel class of anti-malarial drugs.',\n",

Other Plasmodium species also possess highly homologous proteins to falcipains. For selective therapeutic targeting, identification of sequence and structure differences with homologous human cathepsins is necessary. The substrate processing activity of these proteins is tightly controlled via a prodomain segment occluding the active site which is chopped under low pH conditions exposing the catalytic site. Current work characterizes these proteases to identify residues mediating the prodomain regulatory function for the design of peptide based anti-malarial inhibitors.\\nSequence and structure variations between prodomain regions of plasmodial proteins and human cathepsins were determined using in silico approaches. Additionally, evolutionary clustering of these proteins was evaluated using phylogenetic analysis. High quality partial zymogen protein structures were modelled using homology modelling and residue interaction analysis performed between the prodomain segment and mature domain to identify key interacting residues between these two domains. The resulting information was used to determine short peptide sequences which could mimic the inherent regulatory function of the prodomain regions. Through flexible docking, the binding affinity of proposed peptides on the proteins studied was evaluated.\\nSequence, evolutionary and motif analyses showed important differences between plasmodial and human proteins. Residue interaction analysis identified important residues crucial for maintaining prodomain integrity across the different proteins as well as the pro-segment responsible for inhibitory mechanism. Binding affinity of suggested peptides was highly dependent on their residue composition and length.\\nDespite the conserved structural and catalytic mechanism between human cathepsins and plasmodial proteases, current work revealed significant differences between the two protein groups which may provide valuable information for selective anti-malarial inhibitor development. Part of this study aimed to design peptide inhibitors based on endogenous inhibitory portions of protease prodomains as a novel aspect. Even though peptide inhibitors may not be practical solutions to malaria at this stage, the approach followed and results offer a promising means to find new malarial inhibitors.',\n",

Here we provide structural and drug selectivity analyses on CLD interacting residues in apo and holo KRSs from Plasmodium falciparum, Homo sapiens, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Mycobacterium ulcerans. We show that both gross and subtle alterations in protein backbone and sidechains drive the active site structural plasticity that allows integration of CLD in KRSs. The ligand-induced fit of CLD in PfKRS is marked by closure and stabilization of three disordered loops and one alpha helix. However, these structural rearragements are not evident in KRS-CLD complexes from H. sapiens, C. parvum, or M. ulcerans. Strikingly, CLD fits into the MuKRS active site due to a remarkable rotameric alteration in its clash-prone methionine residue that provides accommodation for the methyl moiety in CLD. Although the high concentrations of drugs used for Hs, Cp, and MuKRS-CLD complexes in co-crystallization studies enable elucidation of a structural framework for understanding drug binding in KRSs, we propose that these data should be concurrently assessed via biochemical studies of potency and drug selectivity given the poor cell-based activity of CLD against human and bacterial cells.

Also, comparable functional activity of anti-rPfCelTOS antibodies was found in group that received antigen in either CpG or Poly I:C (69.9%/20% and 73.5%/24.4%, respectively, reductions in intensity/prevalence).

However, immunological characteristic (IgG level, cytophilic IgG2a and IgG2b, avidity, and Th1 cytokines) and TRA of anti-rPfCelTOS significantly enhanced in the presence of co-administration of TLR-based adjuvants, confirming that targeting TLRs would be an effective means for the enhancement of inducing TRA against rPfCelTOS.',\n",

In spite of attempts to design an efficient vaccine, there is not a vaccine against P.\\u202fvivax. Notable advances have recently achieved in the development of malaria vaccines targeting the surface antigens such as Apical Membrane Antigens (AMA)-1. AMA-1 is a micronemal protein synthesized during the erythrocyte-stage of Plasmodium species and plays a significant role in the invasion process of the parasite into host cells. P.\\u202fvivax AMA-1 (PvAMA-1) can induce strong cellular and humoral responses, indicating that it can be an ideal candidate of vaccine against malaria. Identification and prediction of proteins characteristics increase our knowledge about them and leads to develop vaccine and diagnostic studies. In the present study several valid bioinformatics tools were applied to analyze the various characteristics of AMA-1 such as physical and chemical properties, secondary and tertiary structures, B- cell and T-cell prediction and other important features in order to introduce potential epitopes for designing a high-efficient vaccine. The results demonstrated that this protein had 57 potential PTM sites and only one transmembrane domain on its sequence. Also, multiple hydrophilic regions and classical high hydrophilic domains were predicted. Secondary structure prediction revealed that the proportions of random coil, alpha-helix and extended strand in the AMA-1 sequence were 53.74%, 27.22%, and 19.4%, respectively. Moreover, 5 disulfide bonds were predicted at positions 14-21aa, 162-192aa, 208-220aa, 247-265aa and 354-363aa. The data obtained from B-cell and T-cell epitopes prediction showed that there were several potential epitopes on AMA-1 that can be proper targets for diagnostic and vaccine studies. The current study presented interesting basic and theoretical information regarding PvAMA-1, being important for further studies in order to design a high-efficiency vaccine against malaria.',\n",

This result was largely consistent with estimates from mobile phone and travel history data. However, genetic data identified more detailed and extensive evidence of parasite connectivity over hundreds of kilometers than the other data, within Namibia and across the Angolan and Zambian borders.

Regional human migration through underserved endemic areas may be responsible for significant parasite dispersion making the disease resilient to interventions. Thus, the genetic characterization of malarial parasites is an important tool to assess how endemic areas may connect via the movement of infected individuals. Here, four sites in geographically separated areas reporting 80% of the malaria morbidity in Colombia were studied. The sites are located on an imaginary transect line of 1,500 km from the northwest to the south Pacific Coast of Colombia with a minimal distance of 500 km between populations that display noticeable ethnic, economic, epidemiological, and ecological differences.\\nA total of 624 Plasmodium vivax samples from the four populations were genotyped by using eight microsatellite loci. Although a strong geographic structure was expected between these populations, only moderate evidence of genetic differentiation was observed using a suite of population genetic analyses. High genetic diversity, shared alleles, and low linkage disequilibrium were also found in these P. vivax populations providing no evidence for a bottleneck or clonal expansions as expected from recent reductions in the transmission that could have been the result of scaling up interventions or environmental changes. These patterns are consistent with a disease that is not only endemic in each site but also imply that there is gene flow among these populations across 1,500 km.\\nThe observed patterns in P. vivax are consistent with a \"corridor\" where connected endemic areas can sustain a high level of genetic diversity locally and can restore parasite-subdivided populations via migration of infected individuals even after local interventions achieved a substantial reduction of clinical cases.

Since recently cases of artemisinin resistance were reported, novel anti-malarial drugs are required which differ from artemisinins in structure and biological target. The plasmodial glycogen synthase kinase-3 (PfGSK-3) was suggested as a new anti-malarial drug target. 4-Phenylthieno[2,3-b]pyridines were previously identified as selective PfGSK-3 inhibitors with antiplasmodial activity. The present study aims at identifying a molecular position on this scaffold for the attachment of side chains in order to improve solubility and antiplasmodial activity. Furthermore, the role of axial chirality in the compound class for antiplasmodial activity and PfGSK-3 inhibition was investigated.\\n4-Phenylthieno[2,3-b]pyridines with substituents in 4-position of the phenyl ring were docked into the ATP binding site of PfGSK-3. The compounds were synthesized employing a Thorpe reaction as final step. The enantiomers of one congener were separated by chiral HPLC. All derivatives were tested for inhibition of asexual erythrocytic stages of transgenic NF54-luc Plasmodium falciparum. Selected compounds with promising antiplasmodial activity were further evaluated for inhibition of HEK293 cells as well as inhibition of isolated PfGSK-3 and HsGSK-3. The kinetic aqueous solubility was assessed by laser nephelometry.\\nThe para position at the 4-phenyl ring of the title compounds was identified as a suitable point for the attachment of side chains. While alkoxy substituents in this position led to decreased antiplasmodial activity, alkylamino groups retained antiparasitic potency. The most promising of these congeners (4h) was investigated in detail. This compound is a selective PfGSK-3 inhibitor (versus the human GSK-3 orthologue), and exhibits improved antiplasmodial activity in vitro as well as better solubility in aqueous media than its unsubstituted parent structure. The derivative 4b was separated into the atropisomers, and it was shown that the (+)-enantiomer acts as eutomer.\\nThe attachment of alkylamino side chains leads to the improvement of antiplasmodial activity and aqueous solubility of selective PfGSK-inhibitors belonging to the class of 4-phenylthieno[2,3-b]pyridines. These molecules show axial chirality, a feature of high impact for biological activity. The findings can be exploited for the development of improved selective PfGSK-3 inhibitors.',\n",

The distress associated with it has reached colossal scales owing to the development of resistance to most of the clinically available agents. Hence, the search for newer molecules for malaria treatment and cure is an incessant process. After the era of a single molecule for malaria treatment ended, there was an advent of combination therapy. However, lately there had been reports of the development of resistance to many of these agents as well. Subsequently, at present most of the peer groups working on malaria treatment aim to develop novel molecules, which may act on more than one biological processes of the parasite life cycle, and these scaffolds have been aptly termed as Hybrid Molecules or Double Drugs. These molecules may hold the key to hitherto unknown ways of showing a detrimental effect on the parasite.

To evaluate PfCSP vaccines in animal models, challenge by intravenous sporozoite injection is preferentially used. However, in clinical trials, vaccinated human volunteers are exposed to the bites of malaria-infected mosquitoes. In this study, we down-selected Escherichia coli-produced full-length PfCSP (PfCSP-F) and its three truncated PfCSPs based on their abilities to elicit immune response and protection in mice against two challenge models. We showed that immunization with three doses of PfCSP-F elicited high anti-PfCSP antibody titres and 100% protection against the bites of infected mosquitoes. Meanwhile, three-dose truncated PfCSP induced 60%-70% protection after immunization with each truncated PfCSP. Heterologous prime-boost immunization regimen with adenovirus-PfCSP-F and R32LR greatly induced complete protection against intravenous sporozoite injection. Our results suggest that Abs to both anti-repeat and anti-nonrepeat regions induced by PfCSP-F are required to confer complete protection against challenge by the bites of infected mosquitoes, whereas anti-repeat Abs play an important role in protection against intravenous sporozoite injection. Our findings provide a potential clinical application that PfCSP-F vaccine induces potent Abs capable of neutralizing sporozoites in the dermis inoculated by infected mosquitoes and subsequently sporozoites in the blood circulation.',\n",

The increasing prevalence of artemisinin resistant parasites across Southeast Asia highlights the importance of monitoring the parasite importation into China. Artemisinin resistance in the Mekong region is associated with variants of genes encoding the K13 kelch domain protein (pf13k), found in specific genetic backgrounds, including certain alleles of genes encoding the chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) and multidrug resistance transporter PgH1 (pfmdr1).\\nIn this study we investigated the prevalence of drug resistance markers in 72 P. falciparum samples from uncomplicated malaria infections in Tengchong and Yingjiang, counties on the Yunnan-Myanmar border. Variants of pf13k, pfcrt and pfmdr1 are described.\\nAlmost all parasites harboured chloroquine-resistant alleles of pfcrt, whereas pfmdr1 was more diverse. Major mutations in the K13 propeller domain associated with artemisinin resistance in the Mekong region (C580Y, R539T and Y493H) were absent, but F446I and two previously undescribed mutations (V603E and V454I) were identified. Protein structural modelling was carried out in silico on each of these K13 variants, based on recently published crystal structures for the K13 propeller domain. Whereas F446I was predicted to elicit a moderate destabilisation of the propeller structure, the V603E substitution is likely to lead to relatively high protein instability. We plotted these stability estimates, and those for all previously described variants, against published values for in vivo parasitaemia half-life, and found that quadratic regression generates a useful predictive algorithm.\\nThis study provides a baseline of P. falciparum resistance-associated mutations prevalent at the China-Myanmar border. We also show that protein modelling can be used to generate testable predictions as to the impact of pfk13 mutations on in vivo (and potentially in vitro) artemisinin susceptibility.',\n",

Understanding the dual nature from host-parasite interactions can be facilitated by quantifying the variation in parasite prevalence among host species and then comparing that variation to other ecological factors that are known to also shape host communities. Avian haemosporidian parasites (e.g. Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) are abundant and widespread representing an excellent model for the study of host-parasite interactions. Several geographic and environmental factors have been suggested to determine prevalence of avian haemosporidians in bird communities. However, it remains unknown whether host and parasite traits, represented by phylogenetic distances among species and degree of specialization in host-parasite relationships, can influence infection status. The aims of this study were to analyze factors affecting infection status in a bird community and to test whether the degree of parasite specialization on their hosts is determined by host traits. Our statistical analyses suggest that infection status is mainly determined by the interaction between host species and parasite lineages where tolerance and/or susceptibility to parasites plays an essential role. Additionally, we found that although some of the parasite lineages infected a low number of bird individuals, the species they infected were distantly related and therefore the parasites themselves should not be considered typical host specialists. Infection status was higher for generalist than for specialist parasites in some, but not all, host species. These results suggest that detected prevalence in a species mainly results from the interaction between host immune defences and parasite exploitation strategies wherein the result of an association between particular parasite lineages and particular host species is idiosyncratic.',\n",

The most popular antimalarial drugs are focused on the 7-chloro-4-aminoquinoline [e.g., chloroquine (CQ), amodiaquine (AQ), isoquine (IQ), and tebuquine (TBQ)], artemisinin, and atovaquone systems. Recently, endochin has been used as a platform to design a variety of novel potent and safe antimalarial agents named endochin-like quinolones (ELQs). Also, antimalarial quinolones have been constructed from other quinolones drugs such as ICI-56780 and floxacrine. Trifluoromethyl substitution has provided a significant increase in the antimalarial response of many of the designed ELQs against Plasmodium-resistant strains and for in\\xa0vivo models. In particular, attachment of a substituted trifluoromethoxy (or trifluoromethyl in some cases) biaryl side chain at 2-, 3-, 4-, or 6-position of the quinolone core has shown to be crucially important to generate selective and potent novel ELQs. Furthermore, 6-chloro and 7-methoxy moieties on the quinolone core have been identified as essential pharmacophores when the trifluoromethoxy biaryl side chain is placed at 2- or 3-position of the quinolone core. Methyl or ethyl ester attached at 3-position is essential when the trifluoromethoxy aryl side chain is attached at 6- or 7-position of the quinolone core. Some promising ELQs are currently under clinical trials, representing an excellent platform for the design of new potent, selective, effective, and safe antimalarial drugs against emergent resistance malarial models.',\n",

Pfs230 is one of the major TBV candidates, and multiple Pfs230-based vaccines induced antibodies, which prevented oocyst formation in mosquitoes as determined by a standard membrane-feeding assay (SMFA). Pfs230 is a >300\\u202fkDa protein consisting of 14 cysteine motif (CM) domains, and the size and cysteine-rich nature of the molecule have hampered its production as an intact protein. Except for one early study with maltose-binding protein fusion Pfs230 constructs expressed in Esherichia coli, all other studies have focused on only the first four CM domains in the Pfs230 molecule. To identify all possible TBV candidate domains, we systematically produced either single-CM-domain (a total of 14), 2-CM-domain (7), or 4-CM-domain (6) recombinant protein fragments using a eukaryotic wheat germ cell-free expression system (WGCFS). In addition, two more constructs which covered previously published regions, and an N-terminal prodomain construct spanning the natural cleavage site of Pfs230 were produced. Antisera against each fragment were generated in mice and we evaluated the reactivity to native Pfs230 protein by Western blots and immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and functionality by SMFA. All 30 WGCFS-produced Pfs230 constructs were immunogenic in mice. Approximately half of the mouse antibodies specifically recognized native Pfs230 by Western blots with variable band intensities. Among them, seven antibodies showed higher reactivities against native Pfs230 determined by IFA. Interestingly, antibodies against all protein fragments containing CM domain 1 displayed strong inhibitions in SMFA, while antibodies generated using constructs without CM domain 1 showed no inhibition. The results strongly support the concept that future Pfs230-based vaccine development should focus on the Pfs230 CM domain 1.',\n",

To define a protein's function in vivo and thereby validate it as a drug target, highly specific tools are required that modify protein function with minimal cross-reactivity. While modern genetic approaches often offer the desired level of target specificity, applying these techniques is frequently challenging-particularly in the most dangerous malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Our hypothesis is that such challenges can be addressed by incorporating mutant proteins within oligomeric protein complexes of the target organism in vivo. In this manuscript, we provide data to support our hypothesis by demonstrating that recombinant expression of mutant proteins within P.\\xa0falciparum leverages the native protein oligomeric state to influence protein function in vivo, thereby providing a rapid validation of potential drug targets.

The measured thermodynamic signatures of those interactions indicated that despite the high identity among all Hsp90s, they have specific thermodynamic characteristics. Specifically, the interactions with ADP are driven by enthalpy but are opposed by entropy, whereas the interaction with ATP is driven by both enthalpy and entropy. Complimentary structural and molecular dynamics studies suggested that specific interactions with ADP that differ from those with ATP may contribute to the observed enthalpies and entropies.

Epidemiological models predict that strong immune selection can cause antigenic variants to structure into genetically discordant sets of antigenic types (e.g. serotypes). A corollary of this theory is that targets of immunity may be identified by searching for non-overlapping associations of amino acids among co-circulating antigenic variants. We propose a novel population genetics methodology that combines such predictions with phylogenetic analyses to identify genetic loci (epitopes) under strong immune selection. We apply this concept to the AMA-1 protein of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and find evidence of epitopes among certain regions of low variability which could render them ideal vaccine candidates.

In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of a broad range of substrates and inhibitors as well as the inhibitory properties of deoxyguanosine (dG) derivatives were used to assess the PfTMK substructure molecular rearrangements. The estimated changes during the favourable binding of high affinity substrate (TMP) include lower interaction with P-loop, free residue fluctuations of the lid domain and the average RMSD value. The RMSD of TMP complex was higher and more rapidly stabilized than the dGMP complex. The lid domain flexibility is severely affected by dGMP and Î²-thymidine derivatives, while being partially fluctuating with other thymidine derivatives. The TMK-purine (dGMP) complex was slowly and gradually stabilized with lower over all structure flexibility and residue fluctuations especially at the lid domain, which closes the active site during its catalytic state. Thymidine derivatives allow structure flexibility of the lid domain being highly fluctuating in Î±- and Î²-thymidine derivatives and TMP. dG derivatives remains less efficient than thymidine derivatives in inhibiting TMK. The variations in the structural dynamics of the P-loop and lid domain in response to TMP or dGMP might favour thymidine-based compounds.

Moreover, several triazole-based drugs have already used in clinics for the treatment of various diseases, demonstrating the excellent pharmaceutical profiles. Therefore, triazole derivatives have the potential for clinical deployment in the control and eradication of malaria. This review covers the recent advances of triazole derivatives especially triazole hybrids as potential antimalarials. The structure-activity relationship is also discussed to provide an insight for rational designs of more efficient antimalarial candidates.\",\n",

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are valuable tools for diagnosing malaria in remote areas. The majority of RDTs used for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum are based on the detection of the specific histidine-rich proteins (PfHRP2 and PfHRP3). During the last decade, the threat posed by the lack of expression of these antigens and the variability of the proteins on the diagnosis of malaria has been widely discussed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genetic diversity of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 of P. falciparum isolates collected in three Central American countries.\\nDNA samples were amplified and sequenced to assess the diversity of nucleotides and amino acids. A search for known epitopes within the amino acid sequence was carried out, and the sensitivity of the sequences was evaluated according to a predictive model. A phylogenetic analysis was carried out including homologous sequences from different regions of the world. Protein structures were predicted in silico.\\nFive different patterns for PfHRP2 and one pattern for PfHRP3 were identified. Isolates from Central America show a high level of genetic diversity in pfhrp2; however, the amino acid sequences seem to contain enough motifs to be detected by the RDTs currently available.\\nIt is unlikely that the variability of the pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes has a significant impact on the ability of the RDTs to detect the PfHRP antigens in Central America.',\n",

A comparison with PfG6PD (the NADPH-producing part of PfGluPho) indicates that the P. vivax enzyme has higher K\\nThe characterization of PvG6PD makes this enzyme accessible to further drug discovery activities. In contrast to naturally occurring G6PD variants in the human host that can alter the kinetic properties of the enzyme and thus the redox homeostasis of the cells, the naturally occurring PfGluPho variants studied here are unlikely to have a major impact on the parasites' redox homeostasis.

The protocol for this study is registered in PROSPERO (ID=CRD42017056070), an international database of prospectively registered systematic reviews. On January 16, 2016, available literature was searched in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library. All but case studies, which reported prevalence or incidence of Plasmodium infection stratified by socioeconomic status among individuals living in SSA, were included without any limits. Odds Ratio (OR) and Relative Risk (RR), together with 95% CI and p-values were used as effect measures. Heterogeneity was assessed using chi-square, Moran's I2, and tau2 tests. Fixed (I2<30%), random (I2â¥30%) or log-linear dose-response model was used to estimate the summary OR or RR.\\nAfter removing duplicates and screening of titles, abstracts, and full text, 84 articles were found eligible for systematic review, and 75 of them were included in the meta-analyses. Fifty-seven studies were cross-sectional, 12 were prospective cohort, 10 were case-control, and five were randomized control trials. The odds of Plasmodium infection increased among individuals who were living in poor quality houses (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.56-3.23, I2 = 27.7), were uneducated (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.19-1.54, I2 = 72.4.0%), and were farmers by occupation (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.11-1.85, I2 = 0.0%) [p<0.01 for all]. The odds of Plasmodium infection also increased with a decrease in the income (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, tau2<0.001), and wealth index of individuals (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.18-1.35, tau2 = 0.028) [p<0.001 for both]. Longitudinal studies also showed an increased risk of Plasmodium infection among individuals who were living in poor quality houses (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.47-2.25, I2 = 0.0%), were uneducated (OR 1.27, 1.03-1.50, I2 = 0.0%), and were farmers (OR 1.36, 1.18-1.58) [p<0.01 for all].\\nLack of education, low income, low wealth, living in poorly constructed houses, and having an occupation in farming may increase risk of Plasmodium infection among people in SSA. Public policy measures that can reduce inequity in health coverage, as well as improve economic and educational opportunities for the poor, will help in reducing the burden of malaria in SSA.\",\n",

Herein, we explored the possibility of combining the ferrocenyl moiety with a phosphine unit and the subsequent inclusion of gold(i) to derive a molecular framework with demonstrated potential in inhibiting parasitic diseases. A library of 24 compounds consisting of 5 non-functionalized ferrocenyl enones and 19 ferrocenyl phosphine derivatives were synthesized, verified and tested against Plasmodium (P.) falciparum, which allowed us to identify compounds with low micromolar potency against both normal and chloroquine-resistant strains.

The gold complex, namely G3, derived from the hydrophosphination of the terminal furan bearing an enone substrate showed the highest inhibitory potential.

Here, we have studied in vivo expression and localization of a Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) IMC protein 'PfIMC1l' and characterized it functionally by using biochemical assays. We have identified cytoskeletal protein 'actin' and motor protein 'myosin' as novel binding partners of PfIMC1l, alongside its interaction with the lipids 'cholesterol' and 'phosphatidyl-inositol 4, 5 bisphosphate' (PIP2). While actin and myosin compete for interaction with PfIMC1l, actin and either of the lipids (cholesterol or PIP2) simultaneously bind PfIMC1l. Interestingly, PfIMC1l showed enhanced binding with actin in the presence of calcium ions, and displayed direct binding with calcium. Based on our in silico analysis and experimental data showing PfIMC1l-actin/myosin and PfIMC1l-lipid interactions, we propose that this protein may anchor the IMC membrane with the parasite gliding apparatus.

PhLPs are small cytosolic proteins hypothesized to function in G-protein signaling and protein folding. Although PhLPs are highly conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to mammals, only a few representatives have been experimentally characterized to date. In addition, while PhLPs contain a thioredoxin domain, they lack a CXXC motif, a strong indicator for redox activity, and it is unclear whether members of the PhLP family are enzymatically active. Here, we describe PbPhLP-3 as the first phosducin-like protein of a protozoan organism, Plasmodium berghei. Initial transcription analysis revealed continuous low-level expression of pbphlp-3 throughout the complex Plasmodium life cycle. Attempts to knockout pbphlp-3 in P. berghei did not yield live parasites, suggesting an essential role for the gene in Plasmodium. We cloned, expressed and purified PbPhLP-3 and determined that the recombinant protein is redox active in vitro in a thioredoxin-coupled redox assay. It also has the capacity to reduce the organic compound tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) in vitro, albeit at low efficiency. Sequence analysis, structural modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis revealed a conserved cysteine in the thioredoxin domain to be the redox active residue. Lastly, we provide evidence that recombinant human PhLP-3 exhibits redox activity similar to that of PbPhLP-3 and suggest that redox activity may be conserved in PhLP-3 homologs of other species. Our data provide new insight into the function of PhLP-3, which is hypothesized to act as co-chaperones in the folding and regulation of cytoskeletal proteins. We discuss the potential implications of PhLP-3 as a thioredoxin-target protein and possible links between the cellular redox network and the eukaryotic protein folding machinery.',\n",

Apicoplast aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) are bacterial-like enzymes devoted to organellar tRNA aminoacylation. They are all encoded by the nuclear genome and are translocated into the apicoplast only after cytosolic biosynthesis. Apicoplast aaRSs contain numerous idiosyncratic sequence insertions: An understanding of the roles of these insertions has remained elusive and they hinder efforts to heterologously overexpress these proteins. Moreover, the A/T rich content of the Plasmodium genome leads to A/U rich apicoplast tRNA substrates that display structural plasticity. Here, we focus on the P. falciparum apicoplast tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (Pf-apiTyrRS) and its cognate tRNATyr substrate (Pf-apitRNATyr). Cloning and expression strategies used to obtain an active and functional recombinant Pf-apiTyrRS are reported. Functional analyses established that only three weak identity elements in the apitRNATyr promote specific recognition by the cognate Pf-apiTyrRS and that positive identity elements usually found in the tRNATyr acceptor stem are excluded from this set.

These include the PfEMP1 (Pf erythrocyte membrane protein 1) protein family that affects malaria-related mortality through cytoadhesion and parasite immune evasion. Parasites also induce membranous structures called Maurer's clefts (MC) in infected erythrocytes to compensate the lack of host protein synthetic and export machinery. PfEMP1 export is mediated by a myriad of proteins including Pf skeleton binding protein 1 (PfSBP1) and PF70, a hypothetical 16 family member. Here, we aim to understand the function of the only other exported PEXEL-positive hyp16 member 'PfJ23'. Our in vitro and in silico data suggest this protein to be mostly Î±-helical while displaying different oligomeric forms under reducing and non-reducing conditions. We show coherent expression, partial co-localization and direct interaction of purified PfSBP1 with recombinant and native PfJ23. Recombinant and parasite-expressed PfJ23 also bind to the cytoplasmic tail of PfEMP1, and they seem to partly co-localize during parasite development. Both novel binding partners interact simultaneously with PfJ23 in vitro to form a complex. Our results suggest a probable role for PfJ23 in export of PEXEL-negative proteins like PfSBP1 and PfEMP1, furthering our understanding of malaria biology.\",\n",

In the midguts of mosquitoes fed with parasite-infected blood, sexual-stage parasites fertilize to develop into motile ookinetes that traverse midgut epithelial cells and reside adjacent the basal lamina. Therefore, the ookinete is a promising target of transmission-blocking vaccines to break the parasite lifecycle in mosquito vectors. However, the molecular mechanisms of ookinete formation and invasion of epithelial cells have not been fully elucidated. A unique structure called the crystalloid body has been identified in the ookinete cytoplasm by electron microscopy, but its biological functions remain unclear.\\nA recombinant protein of a novel molecule, designated as crystalloid body specific PH domain-containing protein of Plasmodium yoelii (PyCryPH), was synthesized using a wheat germ cell-free system. Specific rabbit antibodies against PyCryPH were obtained to characterize the expression and localization of PyCryPH during sexual-stage parasite development. In addition, PyCryPH knockout parasites were generated by targeted gene disruption to examine PyCryPH function in mosquito-stage parasite development.\\nWestern blot and immunofluorescence assays using specific antibodies showed that PyCryPH is specifically expressed in zygotes and ookinetes. By immunoelectron microscopy it was demonstrated that PyCryPH is localized within crystalloid bodies. Parasites with a disrupted PyCryPH gene developed normally into ookinetes and formed oocysts on the basal lamina of midguts. In addition, the number of sporozoites residing in salivary glands was comparable to that of wild-type parasites.\\nCryPH, containing a signal peptide and PH domain, is predominantly expressed in zygotes and ookinetes and is localized to crystalloid bodies in P. yoelii. CryPH accumulates in vesicle-like structures prior to the appearance of typical crystalloid bodies. Unlike other known crystalloid body localized proteins, CryPH does not appear to have a multiple domain architecture characteristic of the LAP/CCp family proteins. Although CryPH is highly conserved among Plasmodium, Babesia, Theileria, and Cryptosporidium, PyCryPH is dispensable for the development of invasive ookinetes and sporozoites in mosquito bodies.',\n",

These phytochemicals were docked into the ATP-binding site of PfHsp90 using Autodock vina, and docked poses were rescored using PLANTS ChemPlp, X-Score version 1.2 and NNScore version 2.0. Consensus analysis of the scores using rank-by-rank and rank-by-number and receptor-ligand interaction assessment using LigPlot, led to the identification of margolone, margolonone, nimbinone, nimbione, nimosone and sugiol as best ranked potential interacting partners of PfHsp90. Molecular dynamic simulations of PfHsp90-ligand complexes for the six phytochemicals were performed using NAMD 2.9. The RMSD analysis of simulations trajectories, the ligand interaction analysis of receptor-ligand complex, and the free energy of binding with MMPBSA.py script and Bennett's acceptance ratio method (BAR) confirmed that these six phytochemicals may have potential to functionally interact with PfHsp90. However, though sharing several similar interacting residues with standard control binders yet the higher number of hydrogen bonds, higher level of sustained stability during molecular dynamics simulations and better free energy of binding suggest that margolonone, nimbinone and nimbione may have higher functional interaction potential with PfHsp90. Therefore, these phytochemicals may serve as potential leads in antimalarial drug design and development.\",\n",

Here we report the crystal structures of apo-LmACP (wild-type and S37A mutant) at 2.0\\u202fÃ resolution and compare their key features with the structures of holo-LmACP (wild-type) and other type II ACPs from Escherichia coli and Plasmodium falciparum. The crystal structure of apo-LmACP, which is homologous to other type II ACPs, displays some key structural rearrangements as compared to its holo-structure. Contrary to holo-form, which exists predominantly as a monomer, the apo-form exists as a mixture of monomeric and dimeric population in solution. In contrast to the closed structure of apo-LmACP, holo-LmACP structure was observed in an open conformation as a result of reorganization of specific helices and loops. We propose that the structural changes exhibited by LmACP occur due to the attachment of the phosphopantetheine arm and may be a prerequisite for the initiation of fatty acid synthesis. The movement of helix 3 may also play a role in the dissociation of holo-LmACP from its cognate enzymes of the FAS II pathway.',\n",

For example, non-human primates harbour several species of malaria causing parasites of the genus Plasmodium. Studies suggest that for a better understanding of the origin and evolution of human malaria parasites it is important to know the diversity and evolutionary relationships of these parasites in non-human primates. Much work has been undertaken on malaria parasites in wild great Apes of Africa as well as wild monkeys of Southeast Asia however studies are lacking from South Asia, particularly India. India is one of the major malaria prone regions in the world and exhibits high primate diversity which in turn provides ideal setting for both zoonoses and anthropozoonoses. In this study we report the molecular data for malaria parasites from wild populations of Indian non-human primates. We surveyed 349 fecal samples from five different Indian non-human primates, while 94 blood and tissue samples from one of the Indian non-human primate species (Macaca radiata) and one blood sample from M. mulatta. Our results confirm the presence of P. fragile, P. inui and P. cynomolgi in Macaca radiata. Additionally, we report for the first time the presence of human malarial parasite, P. falciparum, in M. mulatta and M. radiata. Additionally, our results indicate that M. radiata does not exhibit population structure probably due to human mediated translocation of problem monkeys. Human mediated transport of macaques adds an additional level of complexity to tacking malaria in human. This issue has implications for both the spread of primate as well as human specific malarias.',\n",

Intriguingly, MSP2 peptides containing the conserved region and the first five residues of the variable disordered regions aggregated more rapidly than a peptide corresponding to the conserved region alone. In contrast, MSP2 peptides extending 8 or 12 residues into the disordered region aggregated more slowly, consistent with the expected inhibitory effect of flanking-disordered sequences on the aggregation of amyloidogenic ordered sequences. Computational analyses indicated that the helical propensity of the ordered region of MSP2 was modulated by the adjacent disordered five residues in a sequence-dependent manner. Nuclear magnetic resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopic studies with synthetic peptides confirmed the computational predictions, emphasizing the correlation between aggregation propensity and conformation of the ordered region and the effects thereon of the adjacent disordered region. These results show that the effects of flanking-disordered sequences on a more ordered sequence may include enhancement of aggregation through modulation of the conformational properties of the more ordered sequence.',\n",
       " '30420038': 'Malaria transmission-blocking vaccines aim to inhibit the development of malaria parasites in mosquitoes by inducing antibodies targeting surface proteins of sexual stage parasites. We have recently identified PyMiGS, a protein specifically expressed in the osmiophilic body of male gametocytes of Plasmodium yoelii (Py). PyMiGS is translocated to the surface of microgametes, and potent transmission-blocking activity was observed in mosquitoes fed on mice passively immunized with antibodies against PyMiGS. Here we demonstrate using a direct feeding assay that recombinant PyMiGS successfully induces anti-PyMiGS antibodies in mice and that the antibodies block parasite development in mosquitoes. We also show using the membrane-feeding assay that rabbit anti-PyMiGS antibody inhibits parasite development in mosquitoes in a dose-dependent manner without complement involvement. To investigate the mode of action of anti-PyMiGS antibodies against parasite development, we observed exflagellation after mixing Py gametocytes with activation medium containing anti-PyMiGS or anti-GST control antibodies. Whereas most microgametes were released from activated male gametocytes in the control group, a significantly reduced number of microgametes were released in the anti-PyMiGS group, with most of the microgametes left attached to the activated male gametocytes. Moreover, anti-PyMiGS antibodies shortened the duration of the active movement of microgametes after the onset of exflagellation. Taken together, these findings suggest that anti-PyMiGS antibodies bind to the microgamete surface immediately after exflagellation, thereby reducing microgamete motility and inhibiting microgamete release from the activated male gametocytes. These results strongly suggest that PyMiGS orthologues in Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax can be promising TBV candidates.',\n",
       " '30419265': \"From the roots of the West African liana Ancistrocladus abbreviatus (Ancistrocladaceae), ten new naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids (7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9-14), displaying three different coupling types (5,1', 5,8', and 7,8'), were isolated, among them a series of five 5,1'-linked representatives and four metabolites belonging to the rare group of 7,8'-coupled alkaloids. Two of the alkaloids, the ancistrobrevines I (13) and J (14), are only the fourth and fifth examples of 7,8'-linked naphthyldihydroisoquinolines ever found in nature. The stereostructures of the new plant metabolites were determined by spectroscopic, chemical (oxidative degradation), and chiroptical (electronic circular dichroism) methods. For the assignment of the axial configuration of 13 and 14 relative to the stereocenter at C-3, which is too far away for significant NOE long-range interactions, these 7,8'-coupled naphthyldihydroisoquinolines were stereoselectively converted into the respective cis-configured tetrahydroisoquinoline analogs. The newly generated 'auxiliary' stereocenter at C-1 permitted decisive NOE interactions between the isoquinoline and the naphthalene parts, and thus a reliable attribution of the axial configuration of 13 and 14. In addition, five known compounds (3, 5, 16, 17, and 20), previously discovered in related African and Asian Ancistrocladus species, have now for the first time been identified in A. abbreviatus. All of these alkaloids are S-configured at C-3 and bear an oxygen function at C-6, and are, thus, typical Ancistrocladaceae-type compounds. Some of the alkaloids of A. abbreviatus exhibited promising activities against the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and PANC-1 human pancreatic cancer cells.\",\n",

The disease causes anaemia and other clinical complications, which can lead to death. Plasmodium vivax is known for its reticulocyte host cell specificity, but many gaps in disease details remain. Much less is known about the closely related species, Plasmodium cynomolgi, although it is naturally acquired and causes zoonotic malaria. Here, a computational model is developed based on longitudinal analyses of P. cynomolgi infections in nonhuman primates to investigate the erythrocyte dynamics that is pertinent to understanding both P. cynomolgi and P. vivax malaria in humans.\\nA cohort of five P. cynomolgi infected Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) is studied, with individuals exhibiting a plethora of clinical outcomes, including varying levels of anaemia. A discrete recursive model with age structure is developed to replicate the dynamics of P. cynomolgi blood-stage infections. The model allows for parasitic reticulocyte preference and assumes an age preference among the mature RBCs. RBC senescence is modelled using a hazard function, according to which RBCs have a mean lifespan of 98\\u2009Â±\\u200921\\xa0days.\\nBased on in vivo data from three cohorts of macaques, the computational model is used to characterize the reticulocyte lifespan in circulation as 24\\u2009Â±\\u20095\\xa0h (n\\u2009=\\u200915) and the rate of RBC production as 2727\\u2009Â±\\u2009209 cells/h/ÂµL (n\\u2009=\\u200915). Analysis of the host responses reveals a pre-patency increase in the number of reticulocytes. It also allows the quantification of RBC removal through the bystander effect.\\nThe evident pre-patency increase in reticulocytes is due to a shift towards the release of younger reticulocytes, which could result from a parasite-induced factor meant to increase reticulocyte availability and satisfy the parasite's tropism, which has an average value of 32:1 in this cohort. The number of RBCs lost due to the bystander effect relative to infection-induced RBC losses is 62% for P. cynomolgi infections, which is substantially lower than the value of 95% previously determined for another simian species, Plasmodium coatneyi.\",\n",

IPT, a malaria control strategy in which a full curative dose of an antimalarial medication is administered to vulnerable asymptomatic individuals at specified intervals, has been shown to reduce malaria transmission and deaths in children and pregnant women. However, it can also promote drug resistance spread. Our mathematical model is used to explore IPT effects on drug resistance and deaths averted in holoendemic malaria regions. The model includes drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains as well as human hosts and mosquitoes. The basic reproduction, and invasion reproduction numbers for both strains are derived. Numerical simulations show the individual and combined effects of IPT and treatment of symptomatic infections on the prevalence of both strains and the number of lives saved. Our results suggest that while IPT can indeed save lives, particularly in high transmission regions, certain combinations of drugs used for IPT and to treat symptomatic infection may result in more deaths when resistant parasite strains are circulating. Moreover, the half-lives of the treatment and IPT drugs used play an important role in the extent to which IPT may influence spread of the resistant strain. A sensitivity analysis indicates the model outcomes are most sensitive to the reduction factor of transmission for the resistant strain, rate of immunity loss, and the natural clearance rate of sensitive infections.',\n",

Plasmodium falciparum M1 alanyl aminopeptidase (PfM1-AAP) is a promising target for the treatment of malaria. The recently solved crystal structures of PfM1-AAP revealed that the buried active site can be accessed through two channel openings: a short N-terminal channel with the length of 8 Ã and a long C-terminal channel with the length of 30 Ã. It is unclear, however, how substrates and inhibitors migrate to the active site and a product of cleavage leaves. Here, we study the molecular mechanism of substrate and inhibitor migration to the active site and the product release using steered molecular dynamics simulations. We identified a stepwise passage of substrates and inhibitors in the C-terminal channel of PfM1-AAP, involving (I) ligand recognition at the opening of the channel, (II) ionic translation to the 'water reservoir', (III) ligand reorientation in the 'water reservoir' and (IV) passage in a suitable conformation into the active site. Endorsed by enzymatic analysis of functional recombinant PfM1-AAP and mutagenesis studies, our novel ligand-residue binding network analysis has identified the functional residues controlling ligand migration within the C-terminal channel of PfM1-AAP. Furthermore, from unbinding simulations of the Arg product we propose a charge repulsion as the driving force to expel the product out from the N-terminal channel of PfM1-AAP.

Several new compounds with novel mechanisms are in clinical development for the treatment of malaria, including DSM265, an inhibitor of Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. To explore the mechanisms by which resistance might develop to DSM265 in the field, we selected for DSM265-resistant P. falciparum parasites in vitro. Any of five different amino acid changes led to reduced efficacy on the parasite and to decreased DSM265 binding to P. falciparum DHODH. The DSM265-resistant parasites retained full sensitivity to atovaquone. All but one of the observed mutations were in the DSM265 binding site, and the remaining C276F was in the adjacent flavin cofactor site. The C276F mutation was previously identified in a recrudescent parasite during a Phase IIa clinical study. We confirmed that this mutation (and the related C276Y) accounted for the full level of observed DSM265 resistance by regenerating the mutation using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. X-ray structure analysis of the C276F mutant enzyme showed that conformational changes of nearby residues were required to accommodate the larger F276 residue, which in turn led to a restriction in the size of the DSM265 binding pocket. These findings underscore the importance of developing DSM265 as part of a combination therapy with other agents for successful use against malaria.',\n",

During comparison with global isolates, a novel non-synonymous mutation (Y240F) was found specifically in a single Pakistani sample with 5% frequency. The less number of mutations, haplotypes, recombination and low pairwise nucleotide differences revealed tightly linked uniform genetic structure with low genetic diversity at HVR domain I of pfama1 among P. falciparum isolates from Hazara region of Pakistan.

Polymorphisms in kelch13 have been associated with clinical and in vitro resistance phenotypes; however, several studies suggest that the genetic determinants of resistance may involve multiple genes. Current proposed mechanisms of resistance conferred by polymorphisms in kelch13 hint at a connection to an autophagy-like pathway in P. falciparum.\\nA SNP in autophagy-related gene 18 (atg18) was associated with long parasite clearance half-life in patients following artemisinin-based combination therapy. This gene encodes PfAtg18, which is shown to be similar to the mammalian/yeast homologue WIPI/Atg18 in terms of structure, binding abilities, and ability to form puncta in response to stress. To investigate the contribution of this polymorphism, the atg18 gene was edited using CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce a T38I mutation into a k13-edited Dd2 parasite. The presence of this SNP confers a fitness advantage by enabling parasites to grow faster in nutrient-limited settings. The mutant and parent parasites were screened against drug libraries of 6349 unique compounds. While the SNP did not modulate the parasite's susceptibility to any of the anti-malarial compounds using a 72-h drug pulse, it did alter the parasite's susceptibility to 227 other compounds.\\nThese results suggest that the atg18 T38I polymorphism may provide additional resistance against artemisinin derivatives, but not partner drugs, even in the absence of kelch13 mutations, and may also be important in parasite survival during nutrient deprivation.\",\n",

We then investigated whether PfRON12 is immunogenic in P. falciparum-infected individuals. The sera from P. falciparum infected individuals in Thailand and Mali reacted with the recombinant PfRON12. Furthermore, human anti-PfRON12 antibodies affinity-purified from Malian serum samples inhibited merozoite invasion of erythrocytes in vitro. Moreover, pfron12 is highly conserved with only 4 non-synonymous mutations in the coding sequence from approximately 200 isolates deposited in PlasmoDB. These results suggest that PfRON12 might be a potential blood-stage vaccine candidate antigen against P. falciparum.',\n",

Plasmodium vivax parasites have the unique feature of forming dormant liver stages (hypnozoites) that can reactivate weeks or months after a parasite-infected mosquito bite, leading to new symptomatic blood stage infections. Efforts to eliminate P. vivax malaria likely will need to target the persistent hypnozoites in the liver. Therefore, research on P. vivax liver stages necessitates a marker for clearly distinguishing between actively replicating parasites and dormant hypnozoites. Hypnozoites possess a densely fluorescent prominence in the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) when stained with antibodies against the PVM-resident protein Upregulated in Infectious Sporozoites 4 (PvUIS4), resulting in a key feature recognizable for quantification of hypnozoites. Thus, PvUIS4 staining, in combination with the characteristic small size of the parasite, is currently the only hypnozoite-specific morphological marker available.\\nHere, the generation and validation of a recombinant monoclonal antibody against PvUIS4 (Î±-rUIS4 mAb) is described. The variable heavy and light chain domains of an Î±-PvUIS4 hybridoma were cloned into murine IgG1 and IgK expression vectors. These expression plasmids were co-transfected into HEK293 cells and mature IgG was purified from culture supernatants. It is shown that the Î±-rUIS4 mAb binds to its target with high affinity. It reliably stains the schizont PVM and the hypnozoite-specific PVM prominence, enabling the visual differentiation of hypnozoites from replicating liver stages by immunofluorescence assays in different in vitro settings, as well as in liver sections from P. vivax infected liver-chimeric mice. The antibody functions reliably against all four parasite isolates tested and will be an important tool in the identification of the elusive hypnozoite.\\nThe Î±-rUIS4 mAb is a versatile tool for distinguishing replicating P. vivax liver stages from dormant hypnozoites, making it a valuable resource that can be deployed throughout laboratories worldwide.',\n",

A previously reported triazolodiamine HsCDK2 inhibitor and the screening hit 4-methylumbelliferone were each selected for an analogue study. The results of this study highlight the difficult balance between optimization of PfPK5 affinity and binding selectivity for PfPK5 over its closest human homologue HsCDK2. Our approach enabled the discovery of several new PfPK5-binding compounds from a modest screening campaign and revealed the first scaffold to have improved PfPK5/HsCDK2 selectivity.

Malaria is caused by a protozoan, Plasmodium falciparum, which is transmitted through the Anopheles mosquito. Malaria treatment is becoming more challenging due to rising resistance against the antimalarial drug, chloroquine. Novel compounds that target aspects of parasite development are being explored in attempts to overcome this wide-spread problem. Anti-malarial drugs target specific aspects of parasite growth and development within the human host. One of the most effective targets is the inhibition of hematin formation, either through inhibition of cysteine proteases or through iron chelation. Metal-thiosemicarbazone (TSC) complexes have been tested for antimalarial efficacy against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of P. falciparum. An array of TSC complexes with numerous transition metals, including ruthenium, palladium, and gold has displayed antiplasmodial activity. Au(I)- and Pd(II)-TSC complexes displayed the greatest potency; 4-amino-7-chloroquine moieties were also found to improve antiplasmodial activity of TSCs. Although promising metal-TSC drug candidates have been tested against laboratory strains of P. falciparum, problems arise when attempting to compare between studies. Future work should strive to completely characterize synthesized metal-TSC structures and assess antiplasmodial potency against several drug-sensitive and drugresistant strains. Future studies need to precisely determine IC50 values for antimalarial drugs, chloroquine and ferroquine, to establish accurate standard values. This will make future comparisons across studies more feasible and potentially help reveal structure-function relationships. Investigations that attempt to link drug structures or properties to antiplasmodial mechanism(s) of action will aid in the design of antimalarial drugs that may combat rising drug resistance.',\n",

The apical structure of sporozoites is conserved with the infective forms of other apicomplexan parasites that have secretory organelles, such as rhoptries and micronemes. Because some rhoptry proteins are crucial for Plasmodium merozoite infection of erythrocytes, we examined the roles of rhoptry proteins in sporozoites. Here, we demonstrate that rhoptry neck protein 2 (RON2) is also localized to rhoptries in sporozoites. To elucidate RON2 function in sporozoites, we applied a promoter swapping strategy to restrict ron2 transcription to the intraerythrocytic stage in the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium berghei. Ron2 knockdown sporozoites were severely impaired in their ability to invade salivary glands, via decreasing the attachment capacity to the substrate. This is the first rhoptry protein demonstrated to be involved in salivary gland invasion. In addition, ron2 knockdown sporozoites showed less infectivity to hepatocytes, possibly due to decreased attachment/gliding ability, indicating that parts of the parasite invasion machinery are conserved, but their contribution might differ among infective forms. Our sporozoite stage-specific knockdown system will help to facilitate understanding the comprehensive molecular mechanisms of parasite invasion of target cells.',\n",

Partly because of these long-lasting infections, women were reported to have a higher density of gametocytes in their peripheral blood, and are considered as a potential reservoir for malaria transmission. To improve pregnancy outcome in areas of high malaria transmission, The WHO recommends intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) during antenatal care visits. The effect of IPTp-SP on gametocyte carriage in infected pregnant women was studied.\\nThe levels of transcription of three gametocytes stage-specific genes Pfs16 (expressed by sexually-committed ring stage parasites and fully matured gametocytes), Pfs25 (expressed by female mature gametocytes) and Pfs230 (expressed by male mature gametocytes) were assessed by real-time PCR in 50 P. falciparum infected women at early pregnancy (before implementation of IPTp-SP), and in 50 infected women at delivery. Sex ratios of male and female gametocytes were determined in these women to assess the effect of IPTp-SP on the gametocyte populations.\\nThe data show that the three transcript types specific to Pfs16, Pfs25 and Pfs230 were detected in all samples, both at inclusion and delivery. Levels of Pfs25 and Pfs230 transcripts were higher at delivery than at inclusion (p\\u2009=\\u20090.042 and p\\u2009=\\u20090.003), while the opposite was observed for Pfs16 (p\\u2009=\\u20090.048). The ratio of male/female gametocyte transcript levels was higher at delivery than at inclusion (p\\u2009=\\u20090.018). Since a mixed gender late stage gametocyte culture was used as a positive control, male and female gametocytes could not be quantified in an absolute way in the samples. However, the amplification reliability of the Pfs25 and Pfs230 markers in the samples could be checked. A relative quantity of each type of Pfs transcript was, therefore, used to calculate the sex ratio proxy.\\nThis study demonstrates that IPTp-SP treatment contributes to modify the parasite populations' structure during pregnancy.

However, most studies on malaria prevention have focused mainly on ITNs and IRS. The aim of this study was therefore to assess malaria prevention practices beyond ITNs and IRS, and associated environmental risk factors including housing structure in rural Wakiso district, Uganda.\\nA clustered cross-sectional survey was conducted among 727 households in Wakiso district. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and observational checklist. The questionnaire assessed participants' household practices on malaria prevention, whereas the checklist recorded environmental risk factors for malaria transmission, and structural condition of houses. Poisson regression modeling was used to identify factors associated with use of mosquito nets by households.\\nOf the 727 households, 471 (64.8%) owned at least one mosquito net. Use of mosquito nets by households was higher with increasing education level of participants-primary (aPR = 1.27 [95% CI: 1.00-1.60]), secondary (ordinary level) (aPR = 1.47 [95% CI: 1.16-1.85]) and advanced level / tertiary (aPR = 1.55 [95% CI: 1.19-2.01]), and higher household income (aPR = 1.09 [95% CI: 1.00-1.20]). Additionally, participants who were not employed were less likely to have mosquito nets used in their households (aPR = 0.83 [95% CI: 0.70-0.98]). Houses that had undergone IRS in the previous 12 months were 42 (5.8%), while 220 (43.2%) households closed their windows before 6.00 pm. Environmental risk factors found at households included presence of vessels that could potentially hold water for mosquito breeding 414 (56.9%), and stagnant water in compounds 144 (19.8%). Several structural deficiencies on houses that could promote entry of mosquitoes were found such as lack of screening in ventilators 645 (94.7%), and external doors not fitting perfectly into walls hence potential for mosquito entry 305 (42.0%).\\nThere is need to increase coverage and utilisation of ITNs and IRS for malaria prevention in Wakiso district, Uganda. In addition, other malaria prevention strategies such as environmental management, and improving structural condition of houses are required to strengthen existing malaria prevention approaches.\",\n",

Here, we show that recombinant, polyhistidine-tagged (his-tagged) Pfs25 can be mixed at the time of immunization with pre-formed liposomes containing cobalt porphyrin-phospholipid, resulting in spontaneous nanoliposome antigen particleization (SNAP). Antigens are stably presented in uniformly orientated display via his-tag insertion in the cobalt porphyrin-phospholipid bilayer, without covalent modification or disruption of antigen conformation. SNAP immunization of mice and rabbits is well tolerated with minimal local reactogenicity, and results in orders-of-magnitude higher functional antibody generation compared with other 'mix-and-inject' adjuvants. Serum-stable antigen binding during transit to draining lymph nodes leads to enhanced antigen uptake by phagocytic antigen-presenting cells, with subsequent generation of long-lived, antigen-specific plasma cells. Seamless multiplexing with four additional his-tagged Plasmodium falciparum polypeptides induces strong and balanced antibody production, illustrating the simplicity of developing multistage particulate vaccines with SNAP immunization.\",\n",

Microneme secreted proteins establish interactions with host cell receptors and induce exocytosis of the rhoptry organelle. Rhoptry proteins are involved in target cell invasion as well as the formation of the parasitophorous vacuole in which parasites reside during development within the host cell. In Plasmodium merozoites, the rhoptry neck protein (RON) complex consists of RON2, RON4, and RON5, and interacts with apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) as a critical structure of the invasion moving junction. PfRON12 is known to localize to the rhoptry neck of merozoites, but its function remains obscure. The roles of RON proteins are largely unknown in sporozoites, the second invasive form of Plasmodium which possesses a conserved apical end secretory structure. Here, we confirm that RON12 is expressed in the rhoptry neck of merozoites in rodent malaria parasites, whereas in contrast we show that RON12 is localized to the rhoptry body in sporozoites.

Although living cells spend great effort to adjust and maintain these asymmetries, little is known about the biophysical phenomena within asymmetric membranes and their role in cellular function. One reason for this lack of insight into such a fundamental membrane property is the fact that the majority of model-membrane studies have been performed on symmetric membranes. Our aim is to overcome this problem by employing a targeted, enzymatic reaction to prepare asymmetric liposomes with phosphatidylserine (PS) primarily in the inner leaflet. To achieve this goal, we use a recombinant version of a water soluble PS decarboxylase from Plasmodium knowlesi, which selectively decarboxylates PS in the outer leaflet, converting it to phosphatidylethanolamine. The extent of decarboxylation is quantified using high-performance thin-layer chromatography, and the local concentration of anionic PS in the outer leaflet is monitored in terms of the Î¶ potential. Starting, for example, with 21\\xa0mol % 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine sodium salt, the assay leads to liposomes with 21\\xa0mol % in the inner and 6\\xa0mol % PS in the outer leaflet.

Despite the success in malaria control, there has been a recent increase in cases in some provinces. In order to understand the changing malaria dynamics in Viet Nam and measure progress towards elimination, the aim of this study was to describe and quantify spatial and temporal trends of malaria by species at district level across the country.\\nMalaria case reports at the Viet Nam National Institute of Malariology, Parasitology, and Entomology were reviewed for the period of January 2009 to December 2015. The population of each district was obtained from the Population and Housing Census-2009. A multivariate (insecticide-treated mosquito nets [ITN], indoor residual spraying [IRS], maximum temperature), zero-inflated, Poisson regression model was developed with spatial and spatiotemporal random effects modelled using a conditional autoregressive prior structure, and with posterior parameters estimated using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with Gibbs sampling. Covariates included in the models were coverage of intervention (ITN and IRS) and maximum temperature.\\nThere was a total of 57,713 Plasmodium falciparum and 32,386 Plasmodium vivax cases during the study period. The ratio of P. falciparum to P. vivax decreased from 4.3 (81.0% P. falciparum; 11,121 cases) in 2009 to 0.8 (45.0% P. falciparum; 3325 cases) in 2015. Coverage of ITN was associated with decreased P. falciparum incidence, with a 1.1% (95% credible interval [CrI] 0.009%, 1.2%) decrease in incidence for 1% increase in the ITN coverage, but this was not the case for P. vivax, nor was it the case for IRS coverage. Maximum temperature was associated with increased incidence of both species, with a 4% (95% CrI 3.5%, 4.3%) and 1.6% (95% CrI 0.9%, 2.0%) increase in P. falciparum and P. vivax incidence for a temperature increase of 1\\xa0Â°C, respectively. Temporal trends of P. falciparum and P. vivax incidence were significantly higher than the national average in Central and Central-Southern districts.\\nInterventions (ITN distribution) and environmental factors (increased temperature) were associated with incidence of P. falciparum and P. vivax during the study period. The factors reviewed were not exhaustive, however the data suggest distribution of resources can be targeted to areas and times of increased malaria transmission. Additionally, changing distribution of the two predominant malaria species in Viet Nam will require different programmatic approaches for control and elimination.',\n",

The assay was validated against purified recombinant antigens, monospecies malaria infections, and noninfected blood samples. To test against samples collected in an endemic setting, Angolan outpatient samples (n = 1267) were assayed.\\nOf 466 Angolan samples positive for at least 1 antigen, the most common antigen profiles were PfHRP2+/pAldo+/pLDH+ (167, 36%), PfHRP2+/pAldo-/pLDH- (163, 35%), and PfHRP2+/pAldo+/pLDH- (129, 28%).

Asymptomatic, chronic infections are advantageous for parasite persistence, particularly in areas where the optimal eco-epidemiological conditions for parasite transmission fluctuate. In chronic infections, the persistence of the antigenic stimulus changes the expression of immune mediators and promotes constant immune regulation, including increases in regulatory T cell populations. These alterations of the immune system could compromise the response to routine vaccination. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of submicroscopic plasmodial infection with P. falciparum and P. vivax during pregnancy on the immune response to the tetanus toxoid vaccine in Colombian women. Expression of different cytokines and mediators of immune regulation and levels of anti-tetanus toxoid (TT) immunoglobulin (Ig)G were quantified in pregnant women with and without submicroscopic plasmodial infection. The anti-TT IgG levels were significantly lower in the infected group compared with the uninfected group. The expression of interferon (IFN)-Î³, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3) was significantly higher in the infected group, while the expression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î² was lower in the group of infected. In conclusion, submicroscopic Plasmodium infection altered the development of the immune response to the TT vaccine in Colombian pregnant women. The impact of Plasmodium infections on the immune regulatory pathways warrants further exploration.',\n",

The binding free energies calculated by Poisson-Boltzmann surface area method resulted within the range between -99.77 and -\\xa043.74\\xa0kcal/mol, which favoured their profound inhibitory affinity. Residues of LytB like His41, His74, Ser222, Ser223, and Asn224 in LytB were the main protagonists in contributing the majority of interaction energies to the ligands.

Genetic diversity can delimit information about gene flow and population differentiation in localities with malaria.\\nObjective: To estimate the genetic diversity of An. triannulatus in five municipalities with high and low incidence of malaria in the department of CÃ³rdoba.\\nMaterials and methods: The entomological collections were done between August and November, 2016, in Tierralta, Puerto Libertador, MontelÃ­bano, SahagÃºn, and Planeta Rica. We used the COI barcoding fragment as molecular marker. The genetic analysis included the estimation of genetic parameters such as the diversity haplotype, the genetic structure, the gene flow, the Tajimaâs D test, the haplotype network, and the phylogenetic relationship.\\nResults: We obtained 148 sequences with a length of 655 nucleotides of the COI gene, from which we derived 44 haplotypes. The H2 and H21 haplotypes were the most frequent in the populations. The values of the Tajimaâs D test were negative and not significant (p>0.10). The genetic structure\\nindex (FST=0.01427) and the gene flow (Nm=17.27) evidenced no differentiation between sampled populations due to the high exchange of migrants.

Nearly 500 proteins of parasitic origin are exported to the parasite-infected red blood cell (RBC) along with PfHsp70-x. The role of PfHsp70-x in the infected human RBC remains largely unclear. One of the defining features of PfHsp70-x is the presence of EEVN residues at its C-terminus.

Here we show that PTEX is a bona fide translocon by determining structures of the PTEX core complex at near-atomic resolution using cryo-electron microscopy. We isolated the endogenous PTEX core complex containing EXP2, PTEX150 and HSP101 from Plasmodium falciparum in the 'engaged' and 'resetting' states of endogenous cargo translocation using epitope tags inserted using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. In the structures, EXP2 and PTEX150 interdigitate to form a static, funnel-shaped pseudo-seven-fold-symmetric protein-conducting channel spanning the vacuolar membrane. The spiral-shaped AAA+ HSP101 hexamer is tethered above this funnel, and undergoes pronounced compaction that allows three of six tyrosine-bearing pore loops lining the HSP101 channel to dissociate from the cargo, resetting the translocon for the next threading cycle. Our work reveals the mechanism of P. falciparum effector export, and will inform structure-based design of drugs targeting this unique translocon.\",\n",

First, we explore issues related to the introduction of fluorescent dyes by cysteine mutagenesis; we discuss the importance of residue selection for dye attachment, and the balance between mutating areas of the protein that will provide useful dynamics while not altering highly conserved residues that could disrupt protein function. To complement and guide the experiments, we used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and computational methods to estimate FRET efficiency distributions for dye pairs at different sites in different protein conformational states.

One of the major challenges for the parasite is the human-to-mosquito transmission, which starts with the differentiation of blood stage parasites into the transmissible gametocytes, followed by the rapid conversion of the gametocytes into gametes, once they are taken up by the blood-feeding Anopheles vector. In order to pre-adapt to this change of host, the gametocytes store transcripts in stress granules that encode proteins needed for parasite development in the mosquito. Here we report on a novel stress granule component, the seven-helix protein 7-Helix-1. The protein, a homolog of the human stress response regulator LanC-like 2, accumulates in stress granules of female gametocytes and interacts with ribonucleoproteins, such as CITH, DOZI, and PABP1. Malaria parasites lacking 7-Helix-1 are significantly impaired in female gametogenesis and thus transmission to the mosquito. Lack of 7-Helix-1 further leads to a deregulation of components required for protein synthesis. Consistently, inhibitors of translation could mimic the 7-Helix-1 loss-of-function phenotype. 7-Helix-1 forms a complex with the RNA-binding protein Puf2, a translational regulator of the female-specific antigen Pfs25, as well as with pfs25-coding mRNA. In accord, gametocytes deficient of 7-Helix-1 exhibit impaired Pfs25 synthesis. Our data demonstrate that 7-Helix-1 constitutes stress granules crucial for regulating the synthesis of proteins needed for life-cycle progression of Plasmodium in the mosquito vector.',\n",

Genetically encoded fluorescent redox sensors have recently been described as powerful tools for determining the glutathione-dependent redox potential in living parasites. In the present study, we genomically integrated and expressed the ratiometric redox sensors hGrx1-roGFP2 (human glutaredoxin 1 fused to reduction-oxidation sensitive green fluorescent protein) and sfroGFP2 (superfolder roGFP2) in the cytosol of NF54- attB blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum parasites. Both sensors were evaluated in vitro and in cell culture with regard to their fluorescence properties and reactivity. As genomic integration allows for the stable expression of redox sensors in parasites, we systematically compared single live-cell imaging with plate reader detection. For these comparisons, short-term effects of redox-active compounds were analyzed along with mid- and long-term effects of selected antimalarial agents. Of note, the single components of the redox probes themselves did not influence the redox balance of the parasites. Our analyses revealed comparable results for both the hGrx1-roGFP2 and sfroGFP2 probes, with sfroGFP2 exhibiting a more pronounced fluorescence intensity in cellulo. Accordingly, the sfroGFP2 probe was employed to monitor the fluorescence signals throughout the parasites' asexual life cycle. Through the use of stable genomic integration, we demonstrate a means of overcoming the limitations of transient transfection, allowing more detailed in-cell studies as well as high-throughput analyses using plate reader-based approaches.\",\n",

Interestingly, the three invasive stages i.e. sporozoites, merozoites, and ookinetes express this protein on their cell surface. Polyclonal anti-Plasmodium falciparum enolase (Pfeno) antibodies disrupt traversal of ookinete through mosquito mid-gut wall as well as have inhibitory effect on parasite growth at erythrocytic stage. In a recent study, it was observed that immunization with a unique epitope of parasite enolase (EWGWS) could confer partial protection against mouse malaria. Further validation is needed for the protective potential of this unique epitope in otherwise highly conserved enolase.\\nIn order to investigate the efficacy of growth inhibitory potential of the epitope of P falciparum enolase, a monoclonal antibody specific to EWGWS is generated. In vitro parasite growth inhibition assays and passive immunization of Plasmodium yoelii (or Plasmodium berghei) infected mice were used to assess the parasite growth neutralizing activity of the antibody.\\nScreening a panel of monoclonal antibodies raised against recombinant Pfeno that were specific to EWGWS resulted in isolation of H12E1. This antibody recognized only EWGWS epitope containing enolases. H12E1 strongly inhibited parasite growth in culture. This inhibition was strain transcending.

This inhibition was species/strain transcending and is likely to arise due to blockade of enolase on the surface of merozoites, functionally implicating Pfeno in invasion related events. Presence of enolase on the cell surface of merozoites and ookinetes could potentially result in inhibition of host cell invasions at erythrocytic and transmission stages in the parasite life cycle. It is suggested that antibodies against EWGWS epitope have the potential to confer dual stage, species and strain transcending protection against malaria.',\n",

Plasmodium spp. (Haemosporida: Plasmodiidae), Anopheles spp. (Diptera: Culicidae), and a suitable host are the key elements for malaria transmission. To disrupt the parasitic life cycle of malaria or prevent its transmission, these three key elements should be targeted by effective control strategies. Development of vaccines that interrupt malaria transmission is one of the solutions that has been recommended to the countries that aim to eliminate malaria. With respect to the important role of Anopheles stephensi in malaria transmission and involvement of Anopheles carboxypeptidase B1 in sexual parasite development, we characterized the second member of cpb gene family (cpbAs2) of An. Stephensi to provide some basic information and evaluate significance of cpbAs2's role in complementing sexual plasmodium development role of cpbAs1. The cpbAs2 mRNA sequence was characterized by 3' and 5' RACE and the structural features of its coded protein were studied by in silico modeling. The coding sequence and gene structure of cpbAs2 were determined empirically and compared with the in silico predictions from the An. stephensi genome sequencing project. Furthermore, homology modeling revealed that its structure is very similar to the structurally important domains of procarboxypeptidase B2 in humans. This study provides basic molecular and structural information about another member of the cpb gene family of An. stephensi. The reported results are informative and necessary for evaluation of the role of this gene in sexual parasite development by future studies.\",\n",

Statistically valid predictive models are reported for a series of 4-aminoquinoline analogues that are active against chloroquine-sensitive (NF54) and chloroquine-resistant (K1) strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Quantitative structure activity relationship techniques, based on statistical and machine learning methods such as multiple linear regression and partial least squares, were used with a novel pruning method for the selection of descriptors to develop robust models for both strains. Inspection of the dominant descriptors supports the hypothesis that chemical features that enable accumulation in the food vacuole of the parasite are key determinants of activity against both strains. The hydrophilic properties of the compounds were found to be crucial in predicting activity against the chloroquine-sensitive NF54 parasite strain, but not in the case of the chloroquine-resistant K1 strain, in line with previous studies. Additionally, the models suggest that 'softer' compounds tend to have improved activity for both strains than do 'harder' ones. The internally and externally validated models reported here should also prove useful in the future screening of potential antimalarial compounds for targeting chloroquine-resistant strains.

We show that rVAR2 efficiently captures CTCs from hepatic, lung, pancreatic, and prostate carcinoma patients with minimal contamination of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Expression of ofCS is present on epithelial and mesenchymal cancer cells and is equally preserved during epithelial-mesenchymal transition of cancer cells. In 25 stage I-IV prostate cancer patient samples, CTC enumeration significantly correlates with disease stage.

However, because of a similarly essential role for the host proteasome, the key property of any antiproteasome therapeutic is selectivity. Several parasite-specific proteasome inhibitors have recently been reported, however, their selectivity must be improved to enable clinical development. Here we describe screening of diverse libraries of non-natural synthetic fluorogenic substrates to identify determinants at multiple positions on the substrate that produce enhanced selectivity. We find that selection of an optimal electrophilic \"warhead\" is essential to enable high selectivity that is driven by the peptide binding elements on the inhibitor. We also find that host cell toxicity is dictated by the extent of coinhibition of the human Î²2 and Î²5 subunits. Using this information, we identify compounds with over 3 orders of magnitude selectivity for the parasite enzyme. Optimization of the pharmacological properties resulted in molecules that retained high potency and selectivity, were soluble, sufficiently metabolically stable and orally bioavailable. These molecules are highly synergistic with ART and can clear parasites in a mouse model of infection, making them promising leads as antimalarial drugs.',\n",

Multiple studies have identified the P. falciparum proteins Pfs25 and Pfs48/45 as prime targets for transmission-blocking vaccines. Although significant advances have been made in recombinant expression of these antigens, they remain difficult to produce at large scale and lack strong immunogenicity as subunit antigens. We linked a self-assembling protein, granule lattice protein 1 (Grl1p), from the ciliated protozoan, Tetrahymena thermophila, to regions of the ectodomains of either Pfs25 or Pfs48/45. We found that resulting protein chimera could be produced in E. coli as nanoparticles that could be readily purified in soluble form. When produced in the E. coli SHuffle strain, fusion to Grl1p dramatically increased solubility of target antigens while at the same time directing the formation of particles with diameters centering on 38 and 25\\u202fnm depending on the antigen. In a number of instances, co-expression with chaperone proteins and induction at a lower temperature further increased expression and solubility. Based on Western blotting and ELISA analysis, Pfs25 and Pfs48/45 retained their transmission-blocking epitopes within E. coli-derived particles, and the particles themselves elicited strong antibody responses in rabbits when given with an aluminum-based adjuvant. Antibodies against Pfs25-containing nanoparticles blocked parasite transmission in standard membrane-feeding assays. In conclusion, fusion to Grl1p can act as a solubility enhancer for proteins with limited solubility while retaining correct folding, which may be useful for applications such as the production of vaccines and other biologics.',\n",

MD simulations of 1000\\xa0ps were performed on PfSOD using GROMACS 5.1.2. For this, the AMBER99SB-ILDN force field was adapted to describe the metal-containing system. The simulations indicated stability in the developed system. Therefore, a covariance matrix was generated, in which it was possible to identify residues with correlated and anticorrelated movements with the active site. These results were associated with the results found in the predictor of allosteric sites, AlloSitePro, which affirmed the ability of these residues to delimit an allosteric site. Then, after successive filtering of the Sigma-AldrichÂ® compounds database for HsSOD1 and PfSOD pharmacophores, 152 compounds were selected, also obeying Lipinski's rule of 5. Further filtering of those compounds based on molecular docking results, toxicity essays, availability, and price filtering led to the selection of a best compound, which was then submitted to MD simulations of 20,000\\xa0ps on the allosteric site.

In this hypothesis, we focused on the similarity of the structure of plerixafor and its analogues with heme functional group of hemoglobin, the main substrate of plasmepsin, and also with some other recent azamacrocyclic compounds demonstrating antimalarial activity, to test whether these compounds are capable of exhibiting antimalarial activity by inhibiting plasmepsin or not. A preliminary in silico docking study was used to evaluate this hypothesis and docking results indicated that macrocyclic cyclams and cyclens can reliably act as potent lead drug or central pharmacophore in developing new plasmepsin inhibitors as compared with previously designed plasmepsin II inhibitors.',\n",

The human defense protein, platelet factor\\xa04 (PF4), has intrinsic antiplasmodial activity but also undesirable chemokine properties. We engineered a peptide containing the isolated PF4 antiplasmodial\\xa0domain, which through cyclization, retained the critical structure of the parent protein. The peptide, cPF4PD, killed cultured blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum with low micromolar potency by specific disruption of the parasite digestive vacuole. Its mechanism of action involved selective penetration and accumulation inside the intraerythrocytic parasite without damaging the host cell or parasite membranes; it did not accumulate in uninfected cells. This selective activity was accounted for by observations of the peptide's specific binding and penetration of\\xa0membranes with exposed negatively charged phospholipid headgroups. Our findings highlight the tremendous potential of the cPF4PD scaffold for developing antimalarial peptide drugs with a distinct and selective mechanism of action.\",\n",

We recruited as cases children presenting with severe malaria to the high-dependency ward of Kilifi County Hospital. We included as controls infants born in the local community between Aug 1, 2006, and Sept 30, 2010, who were part of a genetics study. We tested for associations between a range of candidate malaria-protective genes and risk for severe malaria and its specific phenotypes. We used a permutation approach to account for multiple comparisons between polymorphisms and severe malaria. We judged p values less than 0Â·005 significant for the primary analysis of the association between candidate genes and severe malaria.\\nBetween June 11, 1995, and June 12, 2008, 2244 children with severe malaria were recruited to the study, and 3949 infants were included as controls. Overall, 263 (12%) of 2244 children with severe malaria died in hospital, including 196 (16%) of 1233 with cerebral malaria.

Most annotations of PPIs mix experimental and computational data. The mix optimizes coverage, but obfuscates the annotation origin. Some resources excel at focusing on reliable experimental data. Here, we focused on new pairs of interacting proteins for several model organisms based solely on sequence-based prediction methods.\\nWe extracted reliable experimental data about which proteins interact (binary) for eight diverse model organisms from public databases, namely from Escherichia coli, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Plasmodium falciparum, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Arabidopsis thaliana, and for the previously used Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Those data were the base to develop a PPI prediction method for each model organism. The method used evolutionary information through a profile-kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM). With the resulting eight models, we predicted all possible protein pairs in each organism and made the top predictions available through a web application. Almost all of the PPIs made available were predicted between proteins that have not been observed in any interaction, in particular for less well-studied organisms. Thus, our work complements existing resources and is particularly helpful for designing experiments because of its uniqueness. Experimental annotations and computational predictions are strongly influenced by the fact that some proteins have many partners and others few. To optimize machine learning, recent methods explicitly ignored such a network-structure and rely either on domain knowledge or sequence-only methods. Our approach is independent of domain-knowledge and leverages evolutionary information. The database interface representing our results is accessible from https://rostlab.org/services/ppipair/.

We explored the drug target potential of GRP78, a molecular chaperone that is a regulator of the UPR, for the treatment of P. falciparum parasite infection. By screening repurposed chaperone inhibitors that are anticancer agents, we showed that GRP78 inhibition is lethal to drug-sensitive and -resistant P. falciparum parasite strains in vitro. We correlated the antiplasmodial activity of the inhibitors with their ability to bind the malaria chaperone, by characterizing their binding to recombinant parasite GRP78. Furthermore, we determined the crystal structure of the ATP binding domain of P. falciparum GRP78 with ADP and identified structural features unique to the parasite.

The parasite population in this area was quite diverse with an estimated five subpopulations and evidence of a highly heterogeneous ancestry of some of the isolates, similar to previous analyses of P. vivax in this region. Pairwise comparison of recurrent infections determined that there were 12 homologous relapses and 3 likely heterologous relapses with highly related parasites.

The majority of the genome is relatively stable, with mutation rates similar to most eukaryotic species. However, some regions are very unstable with high recombination rates, driving the generation of new immune evasion-associated var genes. The molecular factors controlling the inconsistent stability of this genome are not known. Here we studied the roles of the two putative RecQ helicases in P. falciparum, PfBLM and PfWRN. When PfWRN was knocked down, recombination rates increased four-fold, generating chromosomal abnormalities, a high rate of chimeric var genes and many microindels, particularly in known 'fragile sites'. This is the first identification of a gene involved in suppressing recombination and maintaining genome stability in Plasmodium. By contrast, no change in mutation rate appeared when the second RecQ helicase, PfBLM, was mutated. At the transcriptional level, however, both helicases evidently modulate the transcription of large cohorts of genes, with several hundred genes-including a large proportion of vars-showing deregulated expression in each RecQ mutant. Aberrant processing of stalled replication forks is a possible mechanism underlying elevated mutation rates and this was assessed by measuring DNA replication dynamics in the RecQ mutant lines. Replication forks moved slowly and stalled at elevated rates in both mutants, confirming that RecQ helicases are required for efficient DNA replication. Overall, this work identifies the Plasmodium RecQ helicases as major players in DNA replication, antigenic diversification and genome stability in the most lethal human malaria parasite, with important implications for genome evolution in this pathogen.\",\n",

Several single nucleotide polymorphisms previously implicated in reduced CQ sensitivity were found. These genetic variations encode amino acids in the two nucleotide-binding domains as well as the transmembrane domains of the protein. The high level of genetic diversity of Pvmdr1 provides insights into the evolutionary history of this gene. Specifically, there was little evidence of positive selection at amino acid F1076L in global isolates to be promoted as a possible marker for CQ resistance. Population genetic analysis clearly divided the parasites into eastern and western populations, which is consistent with their geographical separation by the central malaria-free area of Thailand.

Increasing parasite resistance has imposed restrictions to the currently available antimalarial drugs. Thus, the search for new, effective and safe antimalarial drugs is crucial. Heterocyclic compounds, such as dihydropyrimidinones (DHPM), synthesised via the Biginelli multicomponent reaction, as well as bicyclic compounds synthesised from DHPMs, have emerged as potential antimalarial candidates in the last few years. METHODS Thirty compounds were synthesised employing the Biginelli multicomponent reaction and subsequent one-pot substitution/cyclisation protocol; the compounds were then evaluated in vitro against chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasites (W2 strain). Drug cytotoxicity in baseline kidney African Green Monkey cells (BGM) was also evaluated. The most active in vitro compounds were evaluated against P. berghei parasites in mice. Additionally, we performed an in silico target fishing approach with the most active compounds, aiming to shed some light into the mechanism at a molecular level. RESULTS The synthetic route chosen was effective, leading to products with high purity and yields ranging from 10-84%. Three out of the 30 compounds tested were identified as active against the parasite and presented low toxicity. The in silico study suggested that among all the molecular targets identified by our target fishing approach, Protein Kinase 3 (PK5) and Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3Î² (GSK-3Î²) are the most likely molecular targets for the synthesised compounds.

We previously reported that serum MRP14 is elevated in mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. In order to verify whether extracellular MRP14 is involved in the pathology of hepatic injury during rodent malaria, we intravenously administrated recombinant MRP14 (rMRP14) to mice infected with P. berghei ANKA. The administration of rMRP14 did not affect parasite number or hematocrit. On the other hand, the hepatic injury was exacerbated in rMRP14-treated mice, and their serum concentration of hepatic enzymes increased significantly more than PBS-treated controls. Immunohistochemical analysis of the liver showed that more MRP14+ macrophages accumulated in rMRP14-treated mice than PBS-treated controls after infection. The administration of rMRP14 also promotes the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory molecules in the liver, such as iNOS, IL-1Î², IL-12, and TNF-Î±. Even in the absence of Plasmodium infection, administration of rMRP14 could induce the accumulation of MRP14+ macrophages and up-regulation of the pro-inflammatory molecules in the liver of naÃ¯ve mice. The results indicate that MRP14 promotes the accumulation of MRP14+ cells and the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory molecules and NO, which amplify inflammatory cascade leading to hepatic injury.

Higher responses were observed for the PkSERA3 antigen 2 (67%, 65/97) across all time-points (day 0: 36.9% 34/92; day 7: 63.8% 46/72; day 28: 58.4% 45/77) with significant differences between the clinical cases and controls (n = 55, mean plus 3 SD) (day 0 p<0.0001; day 7 p<0.0001; day 28 p<0.0001). Using boosted regression trees, we developed models to classify P. knowlesi exposure (cross-validated AUC 88.9%; IQR 86.1-91.3%) and identified the most predictive antibody responses.\\nThe PkSERA3 antigen 2 had the highest relative variable importance in all models. Further validation of these antigens is underway to determine the specificity of these tools in the context of multi-species infections at the population level.',\n",

Despite its important role in human Plasmodium transmission, evolutionary history, genetic diversity, and population structure of An. funestus in southern and central Africa remains understudied. We deep sequenced, assembled, and annotated the complete mitochondrial genome of An. funestus s.s. for the first time, providing a foundation for further genetic research of this important malaria vector species. We further analyzed the complete mitochondrial genomes of 43 An. funestus s.s. from three sites in Zambia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania. From these 43 mitogenomes we identified 41 unique haplotypes that comprised 567 polymorphic sites. Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction confirmed the co-existence of two highly divergent An. funestus maternal lineages, herein defined as lineages I and II, in Zambia and Tanzania. The estimated coalescence time of these two mitochondrial lineages is ~500,000 years ago (95% HPD 426,000-594,000 years ago) with subsequent independent diversification. Haplotype network and phylogenetic analysis revealed two major clusters within lineage I, and genetic relatedness of samples with deep branching in lineage II. At this time, data suggest that the lineages are partially sympatric. This study illustrates that accurate retrieval of full mitogenomes of Anopheles vectors enables fine-resolution studies of intraspecies genetic relationships, population differentiation, and demographic history. Further investigations on whether An. funestus mitochondrial lineages represent biologically meaningful populations and their potential implications for malaria vector control are warranted.',\n",

To date, dense granule, the least studied apical organelle, secretes parasite proteins across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) to remodel the infected erythrocyte. Although this phenomenon is key to parasite growth and virulence, only five proteins so far have been identified as dense granule proteins. Further elucidation of dense granule molecule(s) is therefore required. P. falciparum Exported Protein (EXP) 1, previously reported as a parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) protein, is considered essential for parasite growth. In this study, we characterized EXP1 using specific anti-EXP1 antibodies generated by immunization of wheat germ cell-free produced recombinant EXP1. Immunofluorescence microscopy (IFA) demonstrated that EXP1 co-localized with RESA, indicating that the protein is initially localized to dense granules in merozoites, followed by translocation to the PVM. The EXP1 localization in dense granule of merozoites and its translocation to the PVM after invasion of erythrocytes were further confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. Here, we demonstrate that EXP1 is one of the dense granule proteins in merozoites, which is then transported to the PVM after invasion.',\n",

Screening mutated Arabidopsis thaliana seeds for resistance to antimalarial DHFR-inhibitor drugs pyrimethamine and cycloguanil identified causal lesions in DHFR-TS1 and DHFR-TS2, respectively, near the predicted substrate-binding site. The different drug resistance profiles for the plants, enabled by the G137D mutation in DHFR-TS1 and the A71V mutation in DHFR-TS2, were consistent with biochemical studies using recombinant proteins and could be explained by structural models.

A smaller proportion of serum samples contained non-cross-reactive antibodies to variants of each domain; particularly domain II in which amino acid differences significantly influenced antibody recognition. Previous malaria exposure positively affected antibody responses to domain IV. Positive seroconversion and rising antibody titres occurred within a few weeks after resolution of infections.\\nBoth domains II and IV are targets of naturally acquired IgG antibodies. Despite sequence variation in these domains, most antibody responses were cross-reactive. A cross-sectional evaluation of antibodies to PvTRAP during acute infection could underestimate the seroprevalence.',\n",

Delivery of rPfTRAP with poly(I:C) induced high levels and titres of persisted and also high-avidity anti-rPfTRAP IgG antibodies comparable to complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)/incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) adjuvant after the second boost. In addition, rPfTRAP formulated with poly(I:C) elicited a higher ratio of IFN-Î³/IL-5, IgG2a/IgG1, and IgG2b/IgG1 than with CFA/IFA, indicating that poly(I:C) supports the induction of a stronger Th1-based immune response.

Unfortunately however, IBD analyses have been underutilized in analysis of other organisms, including human pathogens. This is in part due to the lack of statistical methodologies for non-diploid genomes in addition to the added complexity of multiclonal infections. As such, we have developed an IBD methodology, called isoRelate, for analysis of haploid recombining microorganisms in the presence of multiclonal infections. Using the inferred IBD status at genomic locations, we have also developed a novel statistic for identifying loci under positive selection and propose relatedness networks as a means of exploring shared haplotypes within populations. We evaluate the performance of our methodologies for detecting IBD and selection, including comparisons with existing tools, then perform an exploratory analysis of whole genome sequencing data from a global Plasmodium falciparum dataset of more than 2500 genomes. This analysis identifies Southeast Asia as having many highly related isolates, possibly as a result of both reduced transmission from intensified control efforts and population bottlenecks following the emergence of antimalarial drug resistance. Many signals of selection are also identified, most of which overlap genes that are known to be associated with drug resistance, in addition to two novel signals observed in multiple countries that have yet to be explored in detail. Additionally, we investigate relatedness networks over the selected loci and determine that one of these sweeps has spread between continents while the other has arisen independently in different countries. IBD analysis of microorganisms using isoRelate can be used for exploring population structure, positive selection and haplotype distributions, and will be a valuable tool for monitoring disease control and elimination efforts of many diseases.',\n",

Strikingly, drug potency between top and worst enantiomers varied 500-fold, and structures of KRS-cladolog complexes reveal that alterations at C3 and C10 are detrimental to drug potency whereas changes at C3 are sensed by rotameric flipping of glutamate 332.

As the superfamily members represent diverse functional classes, to investigate if there is any sequence feature unique to hDJ1-like proteins, sequences of the representative proteins of different functional classes were compared and analysed. A novel motif unique to PfDJ1 and several other hDJ1-like proteins, with the consensus sequence of TSXGPX5FXLX5L, was identified that we designated as the hDJ1-subfamily motif (DJSM). Several mutations that have been associated with Parkinson's disease are also present in DJSM, suggesting its functional importance in hDJ1-like proteins. Mutations of the conserved residues of DJSM of PfDJ1 did not significantly affect overall secondary structure, but caused both a significant loss (S151A and P154A) and gain (L168A) of anti-oxidative activity. We also report that PfDJ1 has deglycase activity, which was significantly decreased in its mutants of the catalytic cysteine (C106A) and DJSM (S151A and P154A). Episomal expression of the catalytic cysteine (C106A) or DJSM (P154A) mutant decreased growth rates of parasites as compared to that of wild type parasites or parasites expressing wild type PfDJ1. S151 appears to properly position the nucleophilic elbow containing C106 and P154 forms a hydrogen bond with C106, which could be a reason for the loss of activities of PfDJ1 upon their mutations.

Therefore, this analysis may suggest new modes of action for non-annotated or even annotated compounds. In perspective, this can be used as a tool for prediction of both antimalarial activity and target for novel, untested compounds.',\n",

Of the sampled aptamers raised against the recombinant protein, rLDH\\xa04 showed the highest binding to the target rPfLDH in the ELONA assay, with both rLDH 4 and rLDH 15 indicating an ability to discriminate between rPfLDH and rPvLDH. LDHp 11 was generated against a peptide selected as a unique P. falciparum LDH peptide. The aptamer, LDHp 11, like antibodies against the same peptide, only detected rPfLDH and discriminated between rPfLDH and rPvLDH. This was supported by affinity binding experiments where only aptamers generated against a unique species-specific epitope showed an ability to preferentially bind to rPfLDH relative to rPvLDH rather than those generated against the whole recombinant protein. In addition, rLDH 4 and LDHp 11 demonstrated in situ binding to P. falciparum cells during confocal microscopy.\\nThe utilization and application of LDHp 11, an aptamer generated against a unique species-specific epitope of P. falciparum LDH indicated the ability to discriminate between recombinant P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax LDH.

An understanding of the targets of functional immune responses during the course of natural infection will aid in the development of a vaccine. Antibodies play a key role in this process, with responses against particular epitopes leading to immune selection pressure on these epitopes. A number of techniques exist to estimate levels of immune selection pressure on particular epitopes, with a sliding window analysis often used to determine particular regions likely to be under immune pressure. However, such analysis neglects protein three-dimensional structural information. With this in mind, a newly developed tool, BioStructMap, was applied to two key antigens from Plasmodium vivax: PvAMA1 and PvDBP Region II. This tool incorporates structural information into tests of selection pressure.\\nSequences from a number of populations were analysed, examining spatially-derived nucleotide diversity and Tajima's D over protein structures for PvAMA1 and PvDBP. Structural patterns of nucleotide diversity were similar across all populations examined, with Domain I of PvAMA1 having the highest nucleotide diversity and displaying significant signatures of immune selection pressure (Tajima's D\\u2009>\\u20090). Nucleotide diversity for PvDBP was highest bordering the dimerization and DARC-binding interface, although there was less evidence of immune selection pressure on PvDBP compared with PvAMA1. This study supports previous work that has identified Domain I as the main target of immune-mediated selection pressure for PvAMA1, and also supports studies that have identified functional epitopes within PvDBP Region II.\\nThe BioStructMap tool was applied to leading vaccine candidates from P. vivax, to examine structural patterns of selection and diversity across a number of geographic populations. There were striking similarities in structural patterns of diversity across multiple populations. Furthermore, whilst regions of high diversity tended to surround conserved binding interfaces, a number of protein regions with very low diversity were also identified, and these may be useful targets for further vaccine development, given previous evidence of functional antibody responses against these regions.\",\n",

In total, 52 distinct haplotypes were found to circulate in these areas. Although population structure based on this locus was observed between each endemic area, no genetic differentiation occurred between populations collected from different periods in the same endemic area, suggesting spatial but not temporal genetic variation. Sequence microheterogeneity in both N- and C- terminal regions was predicted to display 4 and 6 Î±-helical domains, respectively. Signals of purifying selection were observed in Î±-helices II-X, suggesting structural or functional constraint in these domains. By contrast, Î±-helix-I spanning the putative signal peptide was under positive selection, in which amino acid substitutions could alter predicted CD4+ T helper cell epitopes. The central region of PvMSP-7E comprised the 5'-trimorphic and the 3'-dimorphic subregions. Positive selection was identified in the 3' dimorphic subregion of the central domain. A consensus of intrinsically unstructured or disordered protein was predicted to encompass the entire central domain that contained a number of putative B cell epitopes and putative protein binding regions. Evidences of intragenic recombination were more common in the central region than the remainders of the gene.

BSG-PfRh5 is the only essential receptor-ligand pair in P.\\xa0falciparum invasion that is known to date. However, the kind of OK/BSG polymorphism involved in the selection pressure caused by P.\\xa0falciparum malaria has not been determined.\\nBlood samples were collected to detect the expression of OK/BSG. The coding region of PfRh5 was cloned and expressed. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based erythrocyte binding assay was used to measure the recombinant PfRh5 (rPfRh5) binding of RBCs with different OK/BSG expressions. Sequencing of the BSG gene and quantification of the BSG mRNA were performed for selected samples. The candidate microRNAs (miRNAs), which might target the BSG gene, were obtained by miRNA sequencing. Dual-Luciferase reporter assay and overexpression of identified miRNAs were performed in K562 cells.\\nThe rPfRh5 was successfully expressed and verified. The OK/BSG expression levels varied among blood donors and were strongly associated with rPfRh5 binding. No single-nucleotide polymorphism was related to the OK/BSG expression. A potential BSG regulator, miR-501-3p, was identified by miRNA sequencing and Dual-Luciferase assay, but was not proven to regulate the expression of BSG in K562 cells.\\nAlthough the mechanism of OK/BSG expression and regulation on RBCs has not been fully clarified, our findings suggest that the OK/BSG expression levels on RBCs might be related to P.\\xa0falciparum invasion. Moreover, posttranscriptional regulation might play a role in controlling the OK/BSG expression.',\n",

Efforts in finding new drug targets are hampered by the lack of sufficiently specific tools to provide target validation prior to initiating expensive drug discovery projects. Thus, new approaches that can rapidly enable drug target validation are of significant interest. In this manuscript we present the crystal structure of malate dehydrogenase from Plasmodium falciparum (PfMDH) at 2.4 Ã resolution and structure-based mutagenic experiments interfering with the inter-oligomeric interactions of the enzyme. We report decreased thermal stability, significantly decreased specific activity and kinetic parameters of PfMDH mutants upon mutagenic disruption of either oligomeric interface. In contrast, stabilization of one of the interfaces resulted in increased thermal stability, increased substrate/cofactor affinity and hyperactivity of the enzyme towards malate production at sub-millimolar substrate concentrations. Furthermore, the presented data show that our designed PfMDH mutant could be used as specific inhibitor of the wild type PfMDH activity, as mutated PfMDH copies were shown to be able to self-incorporate into the native assembly upon introduction in vitro, yielding deactivated mutant:wild-type species. These data provide an insight into the role of oligomeric assembly in regulation of PfMDH activity and reveal that recombinant mutants could be used as probe tool for specific modification of the wild type PfMDH activity, thus offering the potential to validate its druggability in vivo without recourse to complex genetics or initial tool compounds. Such tool compounds often lack specificity between host or pathogen proteins (or are toxic in in vivo trials) and result in difficulties in assessing cause and effect-particularly in cases when the enzymes of interest possess close homologs within the human host. Furthermore, our oligomeric interference approach could be used in the future in order to assess druggability of other challenging human pathogen drug targets.',\n",

We show that PkMAHRP2 localizes on amorphous structures that connect Sinton Mulligan's clefts (SMC) to each other and to the erythrocyte membrane. Three dimensional reconstruction of the P. knowlesi-infected erythrocyte revealed that the SMC is a plate-like structure with swollen ends, reminiscent of the morphology of the Golgi apparatus.

Currently, most of the diagnostic tests of P. falciparum infection target HRP2, and a number of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against HRP2 have been developed for use in HRP2 detection and quantification. When parasites have HRP2 deletions, the detection of HRP3 could augment the sensitivity of the detection system. The combination of both HRP2 and HRP3 mAbs in the detection system will enhance the test sensitivity. In the HRP quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), both HRP2 and HRP3 contribute to the result, but the relative contribution of HRP2 and HRP3 was unable to investigate, because of the nonavailability of HRP3 specific antibody ELISA. Hence an ELISA test system based on HRP3 is also essential for detection and quantification.

It was demonstrated that transfection with a recombinant plasmid expressing CSP was able to inhibit the proliferation of A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner and induce the apoptosis of A549 cells. A NF-ÎºB gene reporter assay indicated that CSP and its nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif were able to equally suppress the activation of NF-ÎºB following stimulation with human recombinant tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± in A549 cells. Furthermore, western blot analysis indicated that NLS did not affect the phosphorylation and degradation of IÎºB, but was able to markedly inhibit the nuclear translocation of NF-ÎºB in TNF-Î± stimulated A549 cells.

Qualitative data collection included in-depth interviews, informal conversations and participant observations over a 2-month period, and the findings were used to develop the questionnaire used in the cross-sectional survey. The latter collected data on evening activities, mobility patterns and household characteristics. The primary outcome, recent exposure to malaria, was defined using the classification and regression tree method to determine significant changes in antibody titres during the year preceding the survey. Risk factor analyses for recent exposure to malaria were conducted using logistic regression.\\n22 in-depth interviews and numerous participant observations were recorded during the ethnographic research (April to June 2015), and 160 adults (86% response rate) responded to the cross-sectional survey (November to December 2015).

Fungus has been proven to be an excellent source of biologically active compounds, which have been screened for antiplasmodial activity as potential sources of new antimalarial drugs. This review summarizes the current 255 natural products from fungus, which may possess antimalarial activity and can be classified as sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, sesterterpenes, alkaloids, peptides depsipeptides, xanthones, anthraquinones, anthrones, bioxanthracenes, bixanthones, preussomerins, depsidones, phenols, trichothecenes, azaphliones, macrolides, and steroids. However, the treatments available for malaria are limited. Thus, the identification of novel antimicrobial agents should be continued, and all possible strategies should be explored. Carrying forward the antimalarial screening in exited terrestrial and marine natural products library, and finding the new natural products in new resources, particularly those living in marine environments, are still important approaches to find new antimalarial agents. Unusual marine environments are associated with chemical diversity, leading to a resource of novel active substances for the development of bioactive products.

Examining the location of known polymorphisms over all available structures, we observed a strong propensity for polymorphic residues to be exposed on the surface and to occur in particular secondary structure segments such as hydrogen-bonded turns. We also utilised established prediction algorithms for B-cell epitopes and MHC class II binding peptides, examining predicted epitopes in relation to known polymorphic sites within structured regions. Finally, we used the available structures to examine polymorphic hotspots and Tajima's D values using a spatial averaging approach. We identified a region of PfAMA1 involving both domains II and III under a high degree of balancing selection relative to the rest of the protein.

PfEMP1s are major targets of protective immunity. Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to analyse gene expression in 44 parasite isolates that caused severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papuan patients. The transcriptomes of 19 parasite isolates associated with severe malaria indicated that these parasites had decreased glycolysis without activation of compensatory pathways; altered chromatin structure and probably transcriptional regulation through decreased histone methylation; reduced surface expression of PfEMP1; and down-regulated expression of multiple chaperone proteins. Our RNAseq also identified novel associations between disease severity and PfEMP1 transcripts, domains, and smaller sequence segments and also confirmed all previously reported associations between expressed PfEMP1 sequences and severe disease.

In addition, alkyl or halogen-substituted analogues were commercially sourced and tested in parallel. Several TQ analogues with improved potency against ovarian cancer cells and P. falciparum were found, although this increase is suggested to be moderate.

Biochemical studies have identified components of the RNA storage and/or translation inhibitor complex but it is not yet clear how the complex is specifically recruited on the RNA targeted for translation regulation. We used the 3'UTR region of translationally regulated transcripts to identify Phosphatidyl-inositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase (PIP4K2A) as the protein that associates with these RNAs. We further show that recombinant PIP4K2A has the RNA binding activity and can associate specifically with Plasmodium 3'UTR RNAs. Immunostainings show that hPIP4K2A is imported into the Plasmodium parasite from RBC. These results identify a novel RNA binding role for PIP4K2A that may play a role in Plasmodium propagation.\",\n",

In the last years, the situation has become worst in many ways, due to increase in the parasites resistance to various available antimalarial agents. Furthermore, malaria`s control is beginning to be more sophisticated by the parallel spread of mosquito vector`s resistance to the available insecticides. Recently, there is a wide consensus to seek for target specific, safe, affordable, and effective new antimalarial agents, which can compete with synthetic ones. Endophytic fungi are of a growing interest as prominent sources of structurally unique bioactive natural products. The bio-metabolites isolated from endophytic fungi, possessing antimalarial potential may compose the base for the synthesis of novel drugs that might be utilized to withstand malaria and its resistance. For getting information on the various studies, PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Scopus, and Wiley search was done using keywords (malaria, endophytic fungi, and antimalarial activity). The present review covers the literature published from 1996 to 2017 and highlights the metabolites for which antimalarial activities have been reported. Overall, 135 fungal metabolites and 72 references are cited. In addition, their structure, chemical class, fungal source, host, and activity have been presented.

These parasites synthesize glycoconjugates for their survival and infectivity, but the enzymatic steps required to generate the glycosylation precursors are not completely characterized. In particular, glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (GNA1) activity, needed to produce the essential UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) donor, has not been identified in any Apicomplexa. We scanned the genomes of Plasmodium falciparum and representatives from six additional main lineages of the phylum for proteins containing the Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) domain. One family of GNAT-domain containing proteins, composed by a P. falciparum sequence and its six apicomplexan orthologs, rescued the growth of a yeast temperature-sensitive GNA1 mutant. Heterologous expression and in vitro assays confirmed the GNA1 enzymatic activity in all lineages. Sequence, phylogenetic and synteny analyses suggest an independent origin of the Apicomplexa-specific GNA1 family, parallel to the evolution of a different GNA1 family in other eukaryotes. The inability to disrupt an otherwise modifiable gene target suggests that the enzyme is essential for P. falciparum growth.

In this work, we studied in Plasmodium falciparum 3 genes coding for proteins homologues of the mammalian FIS1 (Mitochondrial Fission Protein 1) and DRP1 (Dynamin Related Protein 1) involved in mitochondrial fission. We studied the expression of P.\\xa0falciparum genes that show ample sequence and structural homologies with the mammalian counterparts, namely FIS1, DYN1, and DYN2. The encoded proteins are characterized by a distinct pattern of expression throughout the erythrocytic cycle of P.\\xa0falciparum, and their mRNAs are modulated by treating the parasite with the host hormone melatonin. We have previously reported that the knockout of the Plasmodium gene that codes for protein kinase 7 is essential for melatonin sensing. We here show that PfPk7 knockout results in major alterations of mitochondrial fission genes expression when compared to wild-type parasites, and no change in fission proteins expression upon treatment with the host hormone. Finally, we have compared the morphological characteristics (using MitoTracker Red CMX Ros) and oxygen consumption properties of P.\\xa0falciparum mitochondria in wild-type parasites and PfPk7 Knockout strains. A novel GFP construct targeted to the mitochondrial matrix to wild-type parasites was also developed to visualize P.\\xa0falciparum mitochondria.

Additional local distribution of LLINs occurred in individual villages, but not between 2012 and 2015. A 2011-2012 study of the primary regional malaria vector Anopheles darlingi detected a trend of increased exophagy compared with pre-PAMAFRO behaviour. For the present study, An. darlingi were collected in three villages in Loreto in 2013-2015 to test two hypotheses: (1) that between LLIN distributions, An. darlingi reverted to pre-intervention biting behaviour; and, (2) that there are separate sub-populations of An. darlingi in Loreto with distinct biting behaviour.\\nIn 2013-2015 An. darlingi were collected by human landing catch during the rainy and dry seasons in the villages of Lupuna and Cahuide. The abundance of An. darlingi varied substantially across years, villages and time periods, and there was a twofold decrease in the ratio of exophagic:endophagic An. darlingi over the study period. Unexpectedly, there was evidence of a rainy season population decline in An. darlingi. Plasmodium-infected An. darlingi were detected indoors and outdoors throughout the night, and the monthly An. darlingi human biting rate was correlated with the number of malaria cases. Using nextRAD genotyping-by-sequencing, 162 exophagic and endophagic An. darlingi collected at different times during the night were genotyped at 1021 loci. Based on model-based and non-model-based analyses, all genotyped An. darlingi belonged to a homogeneous population, with no evidence for genetic differentiation by biting location or time.\\nThis study identified a decreasing proportion of exophagic An. darlingi in two villages in the years between LLIN distributions. As there was no evidence for genetic differentiation between endophagic and exophagic An. darlingi, this shift in biting behaviour may be the result of behavioural plasticity in An. darlingi, which shifted towards increased exophagy due to repellence by insecticides used to impregnate LLINs and subsequently reverted to increased endophagy as the nets aged. This study highlights the need to target vector control interventions to the biting behaviour of local vectors, which, like malaria risk, shows high temporal and spatial heterogeneity.',\n",

       " '29452110': 'House is the major site for malaria infection where most human-vector contact takes place. Hence, improving housing might reduce the risk of malaria infection by limiting house entry of vectors. This study aimed to explore the impact of screening doors and windows with wire meshes on density and entomological inoculation rate (EIR) of malaria vector, and malaria incidence, and assess the acceptability, durability, and cost of the intervention. The susceptibility status of malaria vector was also assessed. A two-arm randomized trial was done in Arba Minch Town, southwest Ethiopia. 92 houses were randomly included in the trial. The baseline entomological and malaria prevalence data were collected. The mosquito sampling was done twice per household per month by Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps for six months. The baseline prevalence of malaria was assessed by testing 396 (83% of the 447 study participants) household members in all the eligible houses. The 92 houses were then randomized into control and intervention groups using mosquito and malaria prevalence baseline data to make the two groups comparable except the intervention. Then, we put wire-mesh on doors and windows of 46 houses. Post-screening mosquito collection was done in each household twice per month for three months. Each household member was visited twice per month for six months to assess malaria episodes. The frequency of damage to different structure of screening was measured twice. In-depth interview was conducted with 24 purposely selected household heads from intervention group. Speciation of Anopheles mosquito was done by morphological key, and the circum-sporozoite proteins (CSPs) analysis was done using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A generalized estimating equation with a negative binomial distribution was used to assess the impact of the intervention on the indoor density of vectors. Clinical malaria case data were analyzed using Poisson regression with generalized linear model. Screening doors and windows reduced the indoor density of An. arabiensis by 48% (mean ratio of intervention to control\\u202f=\\u202f0.85/1.65; 0.52) (P\\u202f=\\u202f.001). Plasmodium falciparum CSP rate was 1.6% (3/190) in the intervention houses, while it was 2.7% (10/372) in the control houses. The protective efficacy of screening intervention from CSP positive An. arabiensis was 41% (mean ratio of intervention to control\\u202f=\\u202f1.6/2.7; 0.59), but was not statistically significant (P\\u202f=\\u202f.6). The EIR of An. arabiensis was 1.91 in the intervention group, whereas it was 6.45 in the control group. 477 participants were followed for clinical malaria (50.1% from intervention and 49.9% from the control group). Of 49 RDT positive cases, 45 were confirmed to be positive with microscopy. 80% (n\\u202f=\\u202f36) cases were due to P. falciparum and the rest 20% (n\\u202f=\\u202f9) were due to P. vivax. The incidence of P. falciparum in the intervention group was lower (IRR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.2-0.80; P\\u202f=\\u202f.01) than in the control group. Using incidence of P. falciparum infection, the protective efficacy of intervention was 61% (95% CI: 18-83; P\\u202f=\\u202f.007). 97.9% of screened windows and 63.8% of screened doors were intact after eleven months of installation. Malaria mosquito was resistance (mortality rate of 75%) to the insecticide used for bed nets treatment. Almost all participants of intervention arm were willing to continue using screened doors and windows. Screening doors and windows reduced the indoor exposure to malaria vectors. The intervention is effective, durable and well-accepted. Hence, the existing interventions can be supplemented with house screening intervention for further reduction and ultimately elimination of malaria by reducing insecticide pressure on malaria vectors. However, further research could be considered in broad setting on different housing improvement and in the way how to scale-up for wider community.',\n",

Critical SNPs in a particular, putative amino acid transporter were recently linked to chloroquine (CQ) resistance in malaria parasites.

Heterologous expression of PF3D7_0629500 in yeast produced CQ hypersensitivity, coincident with increased CQ uptake. PF3D7_0629500-expressing cultures were also sensitized to related antimalarials; amodiaquine, mefloquine and particularly quinine. Drug sensitivity was reversed by introducing a SNP linked to CQ resistance in the parasite. Like Tat2p, PF3D7_0629500-dependent quinine hypersensitivity was suppressible with tryptophan, consistent with a common transport mechanism. A four-fold increase in quinine uptake by PF3D7_0629500 expressing cells was abolished by the resistance SNP. The parasite protein localised primarily to the yeast plasma membrane. Its expression varied between cells and this heterogeneity was used to show that high-expressing cell subpopulations were the most drug sensitive. The results reveal that the PF3D7_0629500 protein can determine the level of sensitivity to several major quinine-related antimalarials through an amino acid-inhibitable drug transport function. The potential clinical relevance is discussed.',\n",

Since this enzyme has a key role in parasite development, its unique structure represents a potential target for the discovery of antimalarial drugs. Here we describe the first 3D structural model of the G6PD domain of PfG6PDâ6PGL. Compared to the human enzyme (hG6PD), the 3D model has enabled the identification of a key difference in the substrate-binding site, which involves the replacement of Arg365 in hG6PD by Asp750 in PfG6PD. In a prospective validation of the model, this critical change has been exploited to rationally design a novel family of substrate analog-based inhibitors that can display the necessary selectivity towards PfG6PD. A series of glucose derivatives featuring an Î±-methoxy group at the anomeric position and different side chains at position 6 bearing distinct basic functionalities has been synthesized, and their PfG6PD and hG6PD inhibitory activities and their toxicity against parasite and mammalian cells have been assessed.

It is critical to maintain the progeny free from cross-contamination. Microsatellite polymorphisms can be used to validate parasite identity.\\nA set of 12 markers was developed that differentiates the parents of the four P. falciparum crosses. This typing set identified distinguishing patterns of inheritance (fingerprints) in segregant collections of 15 progeny clones from HB3Ã3D7, 32 from HB3ÃDd2, 33 from 7G8ÃGB4, and 81 from 803ÃGB4.

       " '29391203': 'Plasmodium falciparum cell-traversal protein for ookinetes and sporozoites (PfCelTOS) has been reported as one of the most attractive malaria vaccine candidate antigens. To design a broadly effective malaria vaccine based on this antigen, it is crucial to have adequate information on genetic diversity in global PfCelTOS. Therefore, the extent of sequence diversity at the full-length of the pfceltos was assessed among both natural P. falciparum isolates collected from Iran (n\\u202f=\\u202f93) and from available global pfceltos sequence data retrieved from PlasmoDB database (n\\u202f=\\u202f159). Also, recombination, natural selection, the degree of genetic differentiation as well as the predicted immunodominant regions in PfCelTOS were analyzed. In total, 40 SNPs (including 1 synonymous and 39 non-synonymous) were detected in 34 positions, as compared to 3D7 sequence, which led to 66 distinct haplotypes with different frequencies. Among those haplotypes, 34 (51.5%, excluded from further analysis) were singleton haplotype and mostly detected among Senegalese parasite isolates. PfCelt-1 was found as predominant haplotype (32.6% total frequency) that was only detected in Iranian P. falciparum isolates. Nucleotide diversity was low in French Guiana (0.00236\\u202fÂ±\\u202f0.00203) and Iranian (0.00259\\u202fÂ±\\u202f0.00048) P. falciparum isolates in comparison with African populations. Evidence for positive selection by host immunity and intragenic recombination were detected that are two key factors responsible for gene evolution and genetic diversity of pfceltos gene. The results of Fst analysis and haplotype network revealed that PfCelTOS antigen displayed evident genetic structure between geographical parasite populations. In conclusion, the present analysis demonstrates that there is a limited antigenic diversity and geographic variation in global PfCelTOS, and this finding may be associated with the critical function of this antigen in cell traversal of the parasite in sporozoite and ookinete. Besides, most of the predicted B- and T-cell epitopes were located in the conserved region of the gene, but most of the amino acid replacements were located at the C-terminal region of PfCelTOS. The obtained results in this investigation could provide knowledge for better design of PfCelTOS-based malaria vaccine.',\n",

Analysis of 887 P. vivax microsatellite haplotypes from hyperendemic Papua New Guinea (PNG, n = 443), meso-hyperendemic Solomon Islands (n = 420), and hypoendemic Vanuatu (n = 24) revealed increasing population structure and multilocus linkage disequilibrium yet a modest decline in diversity as transmission decreases over space and time. In Solomon Islands, which has had sustained control efforts for 20 years, and Vanuatu, which has experienced sustained low transmission for many years, significant population structure was observed at different spatial scales.

The VAR2CSA protein plays a crucial role in pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM), and hence quantifying diversity at the var2csa locus in the DRC is important in understanding the basic epidemiology of PAM, and in developing a robust vaccine against PAM.\\nSamples were taken from the 2013-14 Demographic and Health Survey conducted in the DRC, focusing on children under 5\\xa0years of age. A short subregion of the var2csa gene was sequenced in 115 spatial clusters, giving country-wide estimates of sequence polymorphism and spatial population structure.\\nResults indicate that var2csa is highly polymorphic, and that diversity is being maintained through balancing selection, however, there is no clear signal of phylogenetic or geographic structure to this diversity. Linear modelling demonstrates that the number of var2csa variants in a cluster correlates directly with cluster prevalence, but not with other epidemiological factors such as urbanicity.\\nResults suggest that the DRC fits within the global pattern of high var2csa diversity and little genetic differentiation between regions.

While extensive size polymorphisms in GLURP are well recorded, the extent of the sequence diversity of this gene is rarely investigated. The present study aimed to explore the genetic diversity of GLURP in natural populations of P. falciparum.\\nThe polymorphic C-terminal repetitive R2 region of GLURP sequences from 65 P. falciparum isolates in Thailand were generated and combined with the data from 103 worldwide isolates to generate a GLURP database. The collection was comprised of 168 alleles, encoding 105 unique GLURP subtypes, characterized by 18 types of amino acid repeat units (AAU). Of these, 28 GLURP subtypes, formed by 10 AAU types, were detected in P. falciparum in Thailand. Among them, 19 GLURP subtypes and 2 AAU types are described for the first time in the Thai parasite population. The AAU sequences were highly conserved, which is likely due to negative selection. Standard Fst analysis revealed the shared distributions of GLURP types among the P. falciparum populations, providing evidence of gene flow among the different demographic populations.\\nSequence diversity causing size variations in GLURP in Thai P. falciparum populations were detected, and caused by non-synonymous substitutions in repeat units and some insertion/deletion of aspartic acid or glutamic acid codons between repeat units.

Anticancer activity was done using sulforhodamine B assay. Compounds 6b' and 6g' demonstrated promising results against all the tested cell lines. Further, Microscopic view clearly indicated formation of apoptotic bodies, chromatin condensation, shrinkage of cells and bleb formation.

       " '29336158': \"The spatial distribution of genes in chromosomes seems not to be random. For instance, only 10% of genes are transcribed from bidirectional promoters in humans, and many more are organized into larger clusters. This raises intriguing questions previously asked by different authors. We would like to add a few more questions in this context, related to gene orientation inversions. Does gene orientation (inversion) follow a random pattern? Is it relevant to biological activity somehow? We define a new kind of network coined as the gene orientation inversion network (GOIN). GOIN's complex network encodes short- and long-range patterns of inversion of the orientation of pairs of gene in the chromosome. We selected Plasmodium falciparum as a case of study due to the high relevance of this parasite to public health (causal agent of malaria). We constructed here for the first time all of the GOINs for the genome of this parasite. These networks have an average of 383 nodes (genes in one chromosome) and 1314 links (pairs of gene with inverse orientation). We calculated node centralities and other parameters of these networks. These numerical parameters were used to study different properties of gene inversion patterns, for example, distribution, local communities, similarity to ErdÃ¶s-RÃ©nyi random networks, randomness, and so on. We find clues that seem to indicate that gene orientation inversion does not follow a random pattern. We noted that some gene communities in the GOINs tend to group genes encoding for RIFIN-related proteins in the proteome of the parasite. RIFIN-like proteins are a second family of clonally variant proteins expressed on the surface of red cells infected with Plasmodium falciparum. Consequently, we used these centralities as input of machine learning (ML) models to predict the RIFIN-like activity of 5365 proteins in the proteome of Plasmodium sp. The best linear ML model found discriminates RIFIN-like from other proteins with sensitivity and specificity 70-80% in training and external validation series. All of these results may point to a possible biological relevance of gene orientation inversion not directly dependent on genetic sequence information. This work opens the gate to the use of GOINs as a tool for the study of the structure of chromosomes and the study of protein function in proteome research.\",\n",

The predominant causative pathogen of this disease is the intra-erythrocytic parasite Babesia microti. The thioredoxin system is one of the major weapons that is used in the resistance to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) produced by host immune system. In other intra-erythrocytic apicomplexans like the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, anti-oxidative proteins are promising targets for the development of anti-parasitic drugs. However, to date, the sequences and biological properties of thioredoxins and thioredoxin-like molecules of B. microti remain unknown. Understanding the molecular characterization and function of B. microti thioredoxins may help to develop anti-Babesia drugs and controlling babesiosis.\\nThe full-length B. microti thioredoxin 2 (BmTrx2) gene was obtained using a rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method, and the deduced BmTrx2 amino acid sequence was analyzed using regular bioinformatics tools. Recombinant BmTrx2 protein was expressed in vitro and purified using His-tag protein affinity chromatography resins. Reverse transcription PCR, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot were employed to detect the expression and native proteins of BmTrx2. Indirect immunofluorescence assay was used to localize BmTrx2 in B. microti. Bovine insulin reduction assays were used to determine the enzyme activity of the purified recombinant BmTrx2 protein.\\nThe full-length BmTrx2 was 564\\xa0bp with a 408\\xa0bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 135 amino acids. The predicted molecular weight of the protein was 15.5\\xa0kDa. A conserved thioredoxin-like family domain was found in BmTrx2. The expression of BmTrx2 was upregulated on both the third and eighth day post-infection in mice, whereas expression was downregulated during the beginning and later stages. The results of Western blot analysis showed the native BmTrx2 in parasite lysates could be detected by mouse anti-BmTrx2 serum and that the recombinant BmTrx2 protein could be recognized by serum of B. microti-infected mice. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that BmTrx2 localized in the cell cytoplasm of B. microti merozoites in B. microti-infected red blood cells. The results of bovine insulin reduction assay indicated the purified recombinant BmTrx2 protein possesses antioxidant enzyme activity. Dihydroartemisinin and quinine, known anti-malaria drugs, and clindamycin, a known anti-babesiosis drug, induced significantly higher upregulation of BmTrx2 mRNA.\\nOur results indicate that BmTrx2 is a functional enzyme with antioxidant activity and may be involved in the response of B. microti to anti-parasite drugs.',\n",

Here we put forward the hypothesis that the membrane GST Plasmodium falciparum exported protein 1 (PfEXP1, PF3D7_1121600) might be directly involved in the mode of action of the unrelated antimalarial 4-aminoquinoline drug chloroquine (CQ).

Thus, in contrast to ART, CQ may not require activation through an iron source such as hematin for a potent inhibition of membrane GST activity. Arguably, these data represent the first instance of low nanomolar inhibition of an essential Plasmodium falciparum enzyme through a 4-aminoquinoline and might encourage further investigation of PfEXP1 as a potential CQ target candidate.',\n",

Microsatellite genotyping has indicated that human infections in Malaysian Borneo are an admixture of two highly divergent sympatric parasite subpopulations that are, respectively, associated with long-tailed macaques (Cluster 1) and pig-tailed macaques (Cluster 2). Whole-genome sequences of clinical isolates subsequently confirmed the separate clusters, although fewer of the less common Cluster 2 type were sequenced. Here, to analyse population structure and genomic divergence in subpopulation samples of comparable depth, genome sequences were generated from 21 new clinical infections identified as Cluster 2 by microsatellite analysis, yielding a cumulative sample size for this subpopulation similar to that for Cluster 1. Profound heterogeneity in the level of intercluster divergence was distributed across the genome, with long contiguous chromosomal blocks having high or low divergence. Different mitochondrial genome clades were associated with the two major subpopulations, but limited exchange of haplotypes from one to the other was evident, as was also the case for the maternally inherited apicoplast genome. These findings indicate deep divergence of the two sympatric P.\\xa0knowlesi subpopulations, with introgression likely to have occurred recently. There is no evidence yet of specific adaptation at any introgressed locus, but the recombinant mosaic types offer enhanced diversity on which selection may operate in a currently changing landscape and human environment.

Due to a lack of effective vaccines and emerging of drug resistance parasites, development of drugs with novel mechanisms of action and few side effects are imperative. To this end, ideal drug targets are those essential to parasite viability as well as absent in their mammalian hosts. The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) of P. falciparum is one source of such potential targets because enzymes, such as L-malate:quinone oxidoreductase (PfMQO), in this pathway are absent humans. PfMQO catalyzes the oxidation of L-malate to oxaloacetate and the simultaneous reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol. It is a membrane protein, involved in three pathways (ETC, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the fumarate cycle) and has been shown to be essential for parasite survival, at least, in the intra-erythrocytic asexual stage. These findings indicate that PfMQO would be a valuable drug target for development of antimalarial with novel mechanism of action. Up to this point in time, difficulty in producing active recombinant mitochondrial MQO has hampered biochemical characterization and targeted drug discovery with MQO.

Malaria parasite has a complex life cycle and attempts are being made to develop vaccines that target each stage of the life cycle. Oral vaccines seem to be more feasible to implement in poor countries, since they are relatively inexpensive, needle-free administrated, mostly stable at non-refrigerated conditions and painless. By using recombinant technology, suitable oral hosts could serve as antigen delivering vehicles in developing oral vaccines. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii offers beneficial attributes as oral recombinant protein expression platform. Moreover, C. reinhardtii chloroplast is an attractive platform for expressing malaria antigens because it is capable of folding complex proteins, including those requiring disulfide bond formation, while lacking the ability to glycosylate proteins; a valuable quality of any malaria protein expression system, since the Plasmodium parasite lacks N-linked glycosylation machinery. As a first step towards developing an oral vaccine candidate against malaria, here, we expressed a fusion protein consisting of PfCelTOS, a candidate for pre-erythrocytic and transmission-blocking vaccines, fused to human interleukin-2 (IL-2) as vaccine adjuvant in the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii.

The reactive rate of immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 was 1.10% (18/1638), the reactive rate of IgG2 was 0.85% (14/1638), and the reactive rate of IgM was 0.98% (16/1638).\\nSome pathogens that were already considered as threats to blood safety were discovered in those pooled plasma such as C. burnetii, Orientia tsutsugamushi, and Plasmodium sp. As a result, we should initiate some specific tests in the endemic area on plasma donors to enhance the blood safety in China.',\n",

The number of distinct malaria parasite haplotypes identified from an infected human host at a given time is referred to as the complexity of infection (COI). In this study, an amplicon-based deep sequencing method targeting the Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (pfama1) was utilized to (1) investigate the relationship between P. falciparum prevalence and COI, (2) to explore the population genetic structure of P. falciparum parasites from malaria asymptomatic individuals participating in the 2007 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and (3) to explore selection pressures on geospatially divergent parasite populations by comparing AMA1 amino acid frequencies in the DRC and Mali.\\nA total of 900 P. falciparum infections across 11 DRC provinces were examined. Deep sequencing of both individuals, for COI analysis, and pools of individuals, to examine population structure, identified 77 unique pfama1 haplotypes. The majority of individual infections (64.5%) contained polyclonal (COI\\xa0>\\xa01) malaria infections based on the presence of genetically distinct pfama1 haplotypes. A minimal correlation between COI and malaria prevalence as determined by sensitive real-time PCR was identified. Population genetic analyses revealed extensive haplotype diversity, the vast majority of which was shared across the sites. AMA1 amino acid frequencies were similar between parasite populations in the DRC and Mali.\\nAmplicon-based deep sequencing is a useful tool for the detection of multi-strain infections that can aid in the understanding of antigen heterogeneity of potential malaria vaccine candidates, population genetics of malaria parasites, and factors that influence complex, polyclonal malaria infections. While AMA1 and other diverse markers under balancing selection may perform well for understanding COI, they may offer little geographic or temporal discrimination between parasite populations.',\n",

The emergence and spread of growing resistance to the firstline antimalarials are an alarming the serious problem in malaria control, demanding the need for new drugs more potent than earlier with improved Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) profiles. Coumarins, which exhibited various biological properties, also displayed potential in vitro antiplasmodial and in vivo antimalarial activities. Moreover, many of coumarin derivatives have already been used in clinical practice for the treatment of several diseases. Therefore, coumarin derivatives play a pivotal role in medicinal chemistry, also making them promising candidates for the treatment of malaria. This review aims to summarize the recent advances made towards the development of coumarin-containing derivatives as antiplasmodial and antimalarial agents and their structure-activity relationship is also discussed.',\n",
       " '29236299': 'Profilin is one of the actin-binding proteins that regulate dynamics of actin polymerization. It plays a key role in cell motility and invasion. It also interacts with several other proteins notably through its poly-L-proline (PLP) binding site. Profilin in apicomplexa is characterized by a unique mini-domain consisting of a large Î²-hairpin extension and an acidic loop which is relatively longer in Plasmodium species. Profilin is essential for the invasive blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum. In the current study, unbound profilins from Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), Toxoplasma gondii (Tg), and Homo sapiens (Hs) were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for a timeframe of 100\\u2009ns each to understand the conformational dynamics of these proteins. It was found that the Î²-hairpin of profilins from Pf and Tg shows a hinge-like movement. This movement in Pf profilin may possibly be driven by the loss of a salt-bridge within profilin. The impact of this conformational change on actin binding was assessed by docking three dimensional (3D) structures of profilin from Pf and Tg with their corresponding actins using ClusPro2.0. The stability of docked Pf profilin-actin complex was assessed through a 50\\u2009ns MD simulation. As Hs profilin I does not have the apicomplexa specific mini-domain, MD simulation was performed for this protein and its dynamics was compared to that of profilins from Pf and Tg. Using an immunoinformatics approach, potential epitope regions were predicted for Pf profilin. This has a potential application in the design of vaccines as they mapped to its unique mini-domain.',\n",

Recently we have identified multiple proteins as targets of immunity against Plasmodium falciparum using African serum samples. To investigate whether potential targets of clinical immunity differ with transmission intensity, we assessed immune responses in residents of low malaria transmission region in Thailand. Malaria asymptomatic volunteers (Asy: n=19) and symptomatic patients (Sym: n=21) were enrolled into the study. Serum immunoreactivity to 186 wheat germ cell-free system (WGCFS)-synthesized recombinant P. falciparum asexual-blood stage proteins were determined by AlphaScreen, and subsequently compared between the study groups. Forty proteins were determined as immunoreactive with antibody responses to 35 proteins being higher in Asy group than in Sym group. Among the 35 proteins, antibodies to MSP3, MSPDBL1, RH2b, and MSP7 were significantly higher in Asy than Sym (unadjusted p<0.005) suggesting these antigens may have a protective role in clinical malaria. MSP3 reactivity remained significantly different between Asy and Sym groups even after multiple comparison adjustments (adjusted p=0.033). Interestingly, while our two preceding studies using African sera were conducted differently (e.g., cross-sectional vs. longitudinal design, observed clinical manifestation vs. functional activity), those studies similarly identified MSP3 and MSPDBL1 as potential targets of protective immunity. This study further provides a strong rationale for the application of WGCFS-based immunoprofiling to malaria vaccine candidate and biomarker discovery even in low or reduced malaria transmission settings.',\n",

To ensure the accuracy of tRNA aminoacylation, and consequently the fidelity of protein synthesis, some aaRSs exhibit a proofreading (editing) site, distinct from the aa-tRNA synthetic site. The aaRS editing site hydrolyzes misacylated products formed when a non-cognate amino acid is used during tRNA charging. Because aaRSs play a central role in protein biosynthesis and cellular life, these proteins represent longstanding targets for therapeutic drug development to combat infectious diseases. Most existing aaRS inhibitors target the synthetic site, and it is only recently that drugs targeting the proofreading site have been considered. In the present study, we developed a robust assay for the high-throughput screening of libraries of inhibitors targeting both the synthetic and the proofreading sites of up to four aaRSs simultaneously.

Two new Haemoproteus lineages, related to other Haemoproteus transmitted by biting midges, were detected in doves. With regard to sparrows, all detected parasites have previously been reported in other sparrow populations, except for one new Haemoproteus lineage. Our results also showed that densely vegetated sites were characterized by the higher prevalence of Plasmodium but a lower prevalence of Haemoproteus compared with less-vegetated sites.

Genetically modified P. falciparum expressing PvAMA1 evaded the invasion inhibitory effects of antibodies to PfAMA1, demonstrating species specificity of functional antibodies. We generated antibodies to recombinant PvAMA1 that effectively inhibited invasion, confirming the function of PvAMA1 in genetically modified parasites. Results indicate significant molecular flexibility in AMA1 enabling conserved function despite substantial sequence divergence across species.

Here, we have attempted to understand the localization and function of two unexplored proteins of the PHISTc subfamily, PFD1140w and PF11_0503, and compared these with a well-characterized member, PFI1780w. We demonstrate that Phist domains assume different oligomeric states owing to a distinct array of subunit interface residues. Colocalization of a Maurer's cleft signature protein, P.\\xa0falciparum skeleton-binding protein-1 (PfSBP-1), and P.\\xa0falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP-1) revealed different subcellular destinations for these PHIST members.

Interestingly, PFD1140w interacts with PfEMP-1 and PfSBP-1 simultaneously in\\xa0vitro leading to formation of a complex. These two distant PHISTc members also bind PfEMP-1 on distinct sites, despite sharing the Phist domain. Our data re-emphasize a supportive role for PHIST proteins in cytoadhesion, and identify a new binding partner, PfSBP-1, for members of this family.

Infectious disease agents often rely on ribosyltransferase chemistry in pathways involving precursor synthesis for nucleic acids, salvage of nucleic acid precursors, or synthetic pathways with nucleoside intermediates. Here, we review three infectious agents and the use of the Immucillins to taget enzymes essential to the parasites. First, DADMe-Immucillin-G is a purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) inhibitor that blocks purine salvage and shows clinical potential for treatment for the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, a purine auxotroph requiring hypoxanthine for purine nucleotide synthesis. Inhibition of the PNPs in the host and in parasite cells leads to apurinic starvation and death. Second, Helicobacter pylori, a causative agent of human ulcers, synthesizes menaquinone, an essential electron transfer agent, in a pathway requiring aminofutalosine nucleoside hydrolysis. Inhibitors of the H.\\xa0pylori methylthioadenosine nucleosidase (MTAN) are powerful antibiotics for this organism. Synthesis of menaquinone by the aminofutalosine pathway does not occur in most bacteria populating the human gut microbiome. Thus, MTAN inhibitors provide high-specificity antibiotics for H.\\xa0pylori and are not expected to disrupt the normal gut bacterial flora. Third, Immucillin-A was designed as a transition state analogue of the atypical PNP from Trichomonas vaginalis. In antiviral screens, Immucillin-A was shown to act as a prodrug. It is active against filoviruses and flaviviruses. In virus-infected cells, Immucillin-A is converted to the triphosphate, is incorporated into the viral transcript, and functions as an atypical chain-terminator for RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Immucillin-A has entered clinical trials for use as an antiviral. We also summarize other Immucillins that have been characterized in successful clinical trials for T-cell lymphoma and gout. The human trials support the potential development of the Immucillins in infectious diseases.',\n",

       " '29149403': 'The translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is a small, multifunctional protein found in most, if not all, eukaryotic lineages, involved in a myriad of key regulatory processes. Among these, the control of proliferation and inhibition of cell death, as well as differentiation, are the most important, and it is probable that other responses are derived from the ability of TCTP to influence them in both unicellular and multicellular organisms. In the latter, an additional function for TCTP stems from its capacity to be secreted via a nonclassical pathway and function in a non-cell autonomous (paracrine) manner, thus affecting the responses of neighboring or distant cells to developmental or environmental stimuli (as in the case of serum TCTP/histamine-releasing factor in mammals and phloem TCTP in Arabidopsis). The additional ability to traverse membranes without a requirement for transmembrane receptors adds to its functional flexibility. The long-distance transport of TCTP mRNA and protein in plants via the vascular system supports the notion that an important aspect of TCTP function is its ability to influence the response of neighboring and distant cells to endogenous and exogenous signals in a supracellular manner. The predicted tridimensional structure of TCTPs indicates a high degree of conservation, more than its amino acid sequence similarity could suggest. However, subtle differences in structure could lead to different activities, as evidenced by TCTPs secreted by Plasmodium spp. Similar structural variations in animal and plant TCTPs, likely the result of convergent evolution, could lead to deviations from the canonical function of this group of proteins, which could have an impact from a biomedical and agricultural perspectives.',\n",

We report six crystal structures of Pfs25 in complex with antibodies elicited by immunization via Pfs25 virus-like particles in human immunoglobulin loci transgenic mice. Our structural findings reveal the fine specificities associated with two distinct immunogenic sites on Pfs25. Importantly, one of these sites broadly overlaps with the epitope of the well-known 4B7 mouse antibody, which can be targeted simultaneously by antibodies that target a non-overlapping site to additively increase parasite inhibition.

The goal of our studies was to evaluate functional immunogenicity of Pfs48/45 using DNA vaccine format in rhesus macaques. An additional goal was to ensure that when used in combination with another malarial antigen, specific immunity to both antigens was not compromised. For testing combination vaccines, we employed Pfs25 DNA plasmids that have previously undergone evaluations in rodents and nonhuman primates.

However, this accuracy was decreased on test sets, with the highest classification of an independent set of wild-caught larvae reared to set ages being 69.6%.\\nVariation in NIRS data, likely from dietary, genetic, and other factors limits the accuracy of this technique with wild-caught mosquitoes.

The aim of this study was to examine the population genetics and structure of P. vivax isolates from 4 provinces with different malaria endemic settings in Thailand using 6 microsatellite markers. Total 234 blood samples from P. vivax mono-infected patients were collected. Strong genetic diversity was observed across all study sites; the expected heterozygosity values ranged from 0.5871 to 0.9033. Genetic variability in this study divided P. vivax population into 3 clusters; first was P. vivax isolates from Mae Hong Son and Kanchanaburi Provinces located on the western part of Thailand; second, Yala isolates from the south; and third, Chanthaburi isolates from the east. P. vivax isolates from patients having parasite clearance time (PCT) longer than 24 hr after the first dose of chloroquine treatment had higher diversity when compared with those having PCT within 24 hr.

RuvB family is widely studied in various systems such as Escherichia coli, yeast, human, Drosophila, Plasmodium falciparum and mouse, but not well studied in plants. We have studied the transcript level of rice homologue of RuvB gene (OsRuvBL1a) under various abiotic stress conditions, and the results suggest that it is upregulated under salinity, cold and heat stress. Therefore, the OsRuvBL1a protein was characterized using in silico and biochemical approaches. In silico study confirmed the presence of all the four characteristic motifs of AAA+ superfamily-Walker A, Walker B, Sensor I and Sensor II. Structurally, OsRuvBL1a is similar to RuvB1 from Chaetomium thermophilum. The purified recombinant OsRuvBL1a protein shows unique DNA-independent ATPase activity. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the importance of two conserved motifs (Walker B and Sensor I) in ATPase activity has been also reported with mutants D302N and N332H. The OsRuvBL1a protein unwinds the duplex DNA in the 3' to 5' direction. The presence of unique DNA-independent ATPase and DNA unwinding activities of OsRuvBL1a protein and upregulation of its transcript under abiotic stress conditions suggest its involvement in multiple cellular pathways. The first detailed characterization of plant RuvBL1a in this study may provide important contribution in exploiting the role of RuvB for developing the stress tolerant plants of agricultural importance.\",\n",

With optimized process parameters including liquid flow rates and applied electric voltages, experiments are systematically carried out to generate a stable cone-jet mode to produce artemether-loaded PLGA-MPs with an average size of 2 Î¼m, an encapsulation efficiency of 78 Â± 5.6%, and a loading efficiency of 11.7%.

       " '29095572': 'The classical GTP hydrolysis mechanism, as seen in Ras, employs a catalytic glutamine provided in cis by the GTPase and an arginine supplied in trans by a GTPase activating protein (GAP). The key idea emergent from a large body of research on small GTPases is that GTPases employ a variety of different hydrolysis mechanisms; evidently, these variations permit diverse rates of GTPase inactivation, crucial for temporal regulation of different biological processes. Recently, we unified these variations and argued that a steric clash between active site residues (corresponding to positions 12 and 61 of Ras) governs whether a GTPase utilizes the cis-Gln or the trans-Gln (from the GAP) for catalysis. As the cis-Gln encounters a steric clash, the Rab GTPases employ the so-called dual finger mechanism where the interacting GAP supplies a trans-Gln for catalysis. Using experimental and computational methods, we demonstrate how the cis-Gln of Rab33 overcomes the steric clash when it is stabilized by a residue in the vicinity. In effect, this demonstrates how both cis-Gln- and trans-Gln-mediated mechanisms could operate in the same GTPase in different contexts, i.e. depending on the GAP that regulates its action. Interestingly, in the case of Rab5, which possesses a higher intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate, a similar stabilization of the cis-Gln appears to overcome the steric clash. Taken together with the mechanisms seen for Rab1, it is evident that the observed variations in Rab and their GAP partners allow structural plasticity, or in other words, the choice of different catalytic mechanisms.',\n",

Here, the association of antibodies reacting with the Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein-4 (MSP4) with protection against clinical malaria was investigated in a Senegalese community living in an area of moderate, seasonal malaria transmission. Blood samples were collected at the end of an 8-month long dry season without any recorded parasite transmission from 206 residents enrolled in a prospective follow-up study. Active daily clinical monitoring was implemented during the subsequent five months. Entomologic monitoring documented parasite transmission during the first three months of follow-up. Serum IgG levels were determined by ELISA against three MSP4 baculovirus-encoded recombinant protein constructs, namely the full-length MSP4p40, MSP4p30 devoid of a highly polymorphic sequence stretch and the conserved C-terminal EGF-containing MSP4p20, as well as against a merozoite crude extract. Community seroprevalence against all three constructs was quite high, the lowest being against MSP4p30. Seroprevalence and antibody levels against the three MSP4 constructs were age-dependent. IgG1 dominated the anti-MSP4p20 responses, while both IgG1 and IgG3 were observed against MSP4p40. Anti-MSP4 antibodies were associated with the antibody-dependent respiratory burst (ADRB) activity in a functional assay of merozoite phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear cells. Importantly, high antibody levels against each of the three MSP4 constructs at the end of the dry season were associated with reduced morbidity during the subsequent transmission season in an age-adjusted Poisson regression model (IRR\\u202f=\\u202f0.65 [0.50-0.83], P<0.001 for responses over the median values).

Advances in protocols and sequencing technology have made it possible to obtain high-coverage genome-wide sequencing data from blood samples and blood spots taken in the field. However, analyzing and interpreting such data is challenging because of the high rate of multiple infections present.\\nWe have developed a statistical method and implementation for deconvolving multiple genome sequences present in an individual with mixed infections. The software package DEploid uses haplotype structure within a reference panel of clonal isolates as a prior for haplotypes present in a given sample.

       " '28957725': 'Growing resistance in malarial parasites, particularly in Plasmodium falciparum needs a serious search for the discovery of novel drug targets. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) is an important target for antimalarial drug discovery process in P. falciparum for the treatment of malaria. In the absence of x-ray crystal structure of this enzyme, homology modeling proved to be a reasonable alternate to study substrate binding mechanisms of this enzyme. In this study, a 3-D homology model for P. falciparum IMPDH was constructed taking human IMPDH (PDB code 1NF7) as template. Furthermore, an in-silico combinatorial library of ribavirin (RVP) derivatives (1347 molecules) was designed and virtually screened for ligands having selectively greater binding affinity with Plasmodium falciparum IMPDH relative to human IMPDH II. A total of five Ribavirin derivatives were identified as having greater binding affinity (-126 to -108Kcal/mol and -9.4 to -8.6Kcal/mol) with Plasmodium falciparum IMPDH. These five inhibitors should be used as selective and potent for Plasmodium falciparum IMPDH. Such type of study will provide information to synthetic medicinal chemist to enhance the potential of compounds (RVP derivatives) as chemotherapeutic agents to fight against the increasing burden of malarial infections.',\n",
       " '28949547': 'Hemoglobin degradation/hemozoin formation, essential steps in the Plasmodium life cycle, are targets of existing antimalarials. The pathway still offers vast possibilities to be explored for new antimalarial discoveries. Here, we characterize heme detoxification protein, PfHDP, a major protein involved in hemozoin formation, as a novel drug target. Using in silico and biochemical approaches, we identified two heme binding sites and a hemoglobin binding site in PfHDP. Treatment of Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 parasites with peptide corresponding to the hemoglobin binding domain in PfHDP resulted in food vacuole abnormalities similar to that seen with a cysteine protease inhibitor, E-64 (I-1). Screening of compounds that bound the modeled PfHDP structure in the heme/hemoglobin-binding pockets from Maybridge Screening Collection identified a compound, ML-2, that inhibited parasite growth in a dose-dependent manner, thus paving the way for testing its potential as a new drug candidate. These results provide functional insights into the role of PfHDP in Hz formation and further suggest that PfHDP could be an important drug target to combat malaria.',\n",

Several series of inhibitors developed by various research groups display IC50/Ki values down to nM range on native PfA-M1 or recombinant forms and block the parasite development in culture at ÂµM to sub-ÂµM concentrations. A handful of these inhibitors has been tested on murine models of malaria and has shown anti plasmodial in vivo activity. However, most of these inhibitors do also target the other neutral malarial aminopeptidase, PfA-M17, often with lower Ki values, which questions the relative involvement and importance of each enzyme in the parasite biology.\\nAn amino-benzosuberone derivative from a previously published collection of chemicals targeting specifically the M1-aminopeptidases has been identified; it is highly potent on PfA-M1 (Ki\\xa0=\\xa050\\xa0nM) and devoid of inhibitory activity on PfA-M17 (no inhibition up to 100\\xa0ÂµM). This amino-benzosuberone derivative (T5) inhibits, in the ÂµM range, the in vitro growth of two P. falciparum strains, 3D7 and FcB1, respectively chloroquino-sensitive and resistant. Evaluated in vivo, on the murine non-lethal model of malaria Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi, this amino-benzosuberone derivative was able to reduce the parasite burden by 44 and 40% in a typical 4-day Peters assay at a daily dose of 12 and 24\\xa0mg/kg by intraperitoneal route of administration.\\nThe evaluation of a highly selective inhibitor of PfA-M1, over PfA-M17, active on Plasmodium parasites in vitro and in vivo, highlights the relevance of PfA-M1 in the biological development of the parasite as well as in the list of promising anti-malarial targets to be considered in combination with current or future anti-malarial drugs.',\n",

A well-established fermentation strategy is available comprising three main phases: a batch phase, followed by a glycerol fed-batch phase that increases cell density, and finally an induction phase for product expression using methanol as the inducer. We previously used this three-phase strategy at the 15-L scale to express three different AMA1-DiCo-based malaria vaccine candidates to develop a vaccine cocktail. For two candidates, we switched to a two-phase strategy lacking the intermediate glycerol fed-batch phase. The new strategy not only provided a more convenient process flow but also achieved 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold higher space-time yields for the two candidates, respectively, and simultaneously reduced the final cell mass by a factor of 1.3, thus simplifying solid-liquid separation. This strategy also reduced the quantity of host cell proteins that remained to be separated from the two vaccine candidates (by 34% and 13%, respectively), thus reducing the effort required in the subsequent purification steps. Taken together, our new fermentation strategy increased the overall fermentation performance for the production of two different AMA1-DiCo-based vaccine candidates.',\n",

Looking at the population genomics of var genes in cases of uncomplicated malaria, we set out to determine if there was any evidence of a selective sweep of specific var genes or clonal epidemic structure related to the incidence of uncomplicated disease in children. By sequencing the conserved DBLÎ± domain of var genes from six sentinel sites in Uganda we found that the parasites causing uncomplicated P. falciparum disease in children were highly diverse and that every child had a unique var DBLÎ± repertoire. Despite extensive var DBLÎ± diversity and minimal overlap between repertoires, specific DBLÎ± types and groups were conserved at the population level across Uganda. This pattern was the same regardless of the geographic distance or malaria transmission intensity. These data lead us to propose that any parasite can cause uncomplicated malarial disease and that these diverse parasite repertoires are composed of both upsA and non-upsA var gene groups.',\n",

Parasites infecting humans originate from genetically distinct subpopulations associated with the long-tailed (Macaca fascicularis (Mf)) or pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina (Mn)). We used a new high-quality reference genome to re-evaluate previously described subpopulations among human and macaque isolates from Malaysian-Borneo and Peninsular-Malaysia. Nuclear genomes were dimorphic, as expected, but new evidence of chromosomal-segment exchanges between subpopulations was found. A large segment on chromosome 8 originating from the Mn subpopulation and containing genes encoding proteins expressed in mosquito-borne parasite stages, was found in Mf genotypes. By contrast, non-recombining organelle genomes partitioned into 3 deeply branched lineages, unlinked with nuclear genomic dimorphism. Subpopulations which diverged in isolation have re-connected, possibly due to deforestation and disruption of wild macaque habitats. The resulting genomic mosaics reveal traits selected by host-vector-parasite interactions in a setting of ecological transition.',\n",

       " '28898049': \"Chloroquine (CQ) resistance (CQR) in Plasmodium falciparum malaria is widespread and has limited the use of CQ in many regions of the globe. Malaria caused by the related human parasite P. vivax is as widespread as is P. falciparum malaria and has been treated with CQ as extensively as has P. falciparum, suggesting that P. vivax parasites have been selected with CQ as profoundly as have P. falciparum parasites. Indeed, a growing number of clinical reports have presented data suggesting increased P. vivax CQR. Cytostatic (growth inhibitory) CQR for P. falciparum is caused by Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT) mutations, and it has been proposed that mutations in the PvCRT orthologue may simliarly cause P. vivax CQR via increasing CQ transport from the P. vivax digestive vacuole. Here we report the first quantitative analysis of drug transport mediated by all known mutant isoforms of Plasmodium vivax chloroquine resistance transporter (PvCRT) in order to test the protein's potential link to growing P. vivax CQR phenomena. Small, but statistically significant, differences in the transport of CQ and other quinoline antimalarial drugs were found for multiple PvCRT isoforms, relative to wild type PvCRT, suggesting that mutations in PvCRT can contribute to P. vivax CQR and other examples of quinoline antimalarial drug resistance.\",\n",
       " '28893687': 'Pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) poses a threat to both the mother and fetus, increasing the risk of severe maternal anemia, fetal growth restriction and low birth weight infants. Two vaccines are currently in development to protect women from Plasmodium falciparum in pregnancy. Both vaccine constructs target the ID1-DBL2X domain of VAR2CSA, a protein expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes (IEs) that mediates parasite sequestration in the placenta. Although development of an effective vaccine may be hampered by ID1-DBL2X polymorphisms expressed by field isolates, a recent study showed that genetic variation of this domain in South American parasite populations is much lower than in other geographical locations. This suggests that a recombinant vaccine designed to be efficacious in Africa and Asia is likely to be efficacious in South America. However, these studies did not include Colombian parasite populations in their analyses, which are known to be genetically distinct from other South American parasite populations due to their independent introduction from Africa. Therefore, we sought to determine the genetic variation of the ID1-DBL2X domain in Colombian parasites to assess the potential efficacy of the vaccine against PAM in this region. Through sequence analysis and population genetics, we show that there is a low degree of genetic variation amongst Colombian parasite populations and that a vaccine containing conserved antigen variants for worldwide populations is likely to be protective against PAM in Colombia. Our analysis also points towards an African origin for Colombian parasite populations, and suggests that their introduction into Colombia was a recurrent process encompassing multiple introduction events.',\n",

This study aimed to demonstrate the presence of inhibitory antibodies and memory B cell responses to the PvMSP1P-19 antigen during acute P. vivax infection and after recovery from infection.\\nTo evaluate the antibody responses to PvMSP1P-19 during and after recovery from P. vivax infection, heparinized blood was collected from P. vivax-infected patients and recovered subjects to detect the total IgG response. The seropositive samples were defined into high and low responders, according to their optical density (OD) values obtained from ELISA. High responders were the subjects who had OD values above the OD of antisera from non-exposed controls plus 4Ã standard deviations, whereas low responders were the subjects who had OD values less than OD of antisera from non-exposed controls plus 4Ã standard deviations. The plasma from high and low responders were taken for testing the inhibitory activity against PvMSP1P-19-erythrocyte binding by in vitro EBIA. The sustainability of PvMSP1P-19-specific memory B cell responses after recovery from infection was analysed by ELISPOT.\\nThe anti-PvMSP1P-19 antibody levels were significantly higher in acutely infected P. vivax patients compared to healthy controls (P\\xa0<\\xa0\\u20090.0001). Monitoring of the anti-PvMSP1P-19 antibody titre showed that the antibody was maintained for up to 9\\xa0months after recovery. Almost all high-responder groups strongly inhibited PvMSP1P-19 binding to erythrocytes, whereas no inhibition was shown in most low-responder samples.

The longevity of the antibody response was associated with the presence of PvMSP1P-19-specific memory B cells at 9\\xa0months after recovery from infection.\\nThe PvMSP1P-19 antigen has immunogenicity during the induction of the antibody response, in which both the levels and inhibitory activity are maintained after the patient recovered from P. vivax infection. The maintenance of the antibody response was associated with the response of PvMSP1P-19-specific memory B cells.

Understanding this evolution can inform the deployment of new therapies. We investigated the genetic architecture of 78 falciparum isolates using whole-genome sequencing, correlating results to in vivo and ex vivo drug resistance and exploring the relationship between population structure, demographic history, and partner drug resistance. Principle component analysis, network analysis and demographic inference identified a diverse central population with three clusters of clonally expanding parasite populations, each associated with specific K13 artemisinin resistance alleles and partner drug resistance profiles which were consistent with the sequential deployment of artemisinin combination therapies in the region. One cluster displayed ex vivo piperaquine resistance and mefloquine sensitivity with a high rate of in vivo failure of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Another cluster displayed ex vivo mefloquine resistance and piperaquine sensitivity with high in vivo efficacy of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. The final cluster was clonal and displayed intermediate sensitivity to both drugs. Variations in recently described piperaquine resistance markers did not explain the difference in mean IC90 or clinical failures between the high and intermediate piperaquine resistance groups, suggesting additional loci may be involved in resistance. The results highlight an important role for partner drug resistance in shaping the P. falciparum genetic landscape in Southeast Asia and suggest that further work is needed to evaluate for other mutations that drive piperaquine resistance.',\n",

We generated a Plasmodium berghei reporter parasite line by GFP-tagging of a non-essential PPM-localized protein, and followed plasma membrane development in living parasites through the entire Plasmodium life cycle. By generating double-fluorescent parasites in which the PPM is visualized in combination with the parasite endoplasmic reticulum, we show that membrane contact sites are formed between both membrane systems during oocyst and liver stage development that might be used to deliver lipids to the dramatically expanding PPM. In conclusion, we have established a powerful tool to follow PPM development in living parasites, which promises to greatly expand our knowledge of membrane biology in the Plasmodium parasite.',\n",

Some of these exported proteins have been discovered and studied for use as a blood-stage malaria vaccine. The P. vivax glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored micronemal antigen (PvGAMA) was identified in previous study, which plays an important role in parasite invasion. To support the hypothesis that PvGAMA can induce an immune response in natural exposure, the antibody responses and cellular immunity against this antigen was demonstrated during and post-infection.\\nThe recombinant protein PvGAMA was expressed and purified by wheat germ cell-free (WGCF) system. The analysis of humoral and cellular immune responses to the PvGAMA antigen during infection and post-infection with the P. vivax parasite were done by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques.\\nDuring P. vivax infection, 95% of patients showed significant antibody responses to PvGAMA antigen. The cytophilic IgG1 and IgG3 isotypes were the major isotypes produced in response to PvGAMA. A cross-sectional study of anti-PvGAMA responses during and post-infection with P. vivax found that the majority of individuals, approximately 54% of patients, were shown to maintain a positive anti-PvGAMA titre at 3\\xa0months post-infection, and some patients had the ability to maintain an antibody response for up to 12\\xa0months post-infection.

The selective pressure of chloroquine therapy led to the rapid emergence of chloroquine resistant parasites. Resistance has been attributed to the Plasmodium falciparum Chloroquine Resistance Transporter (PfCRT), an integral membrane protein of unknown structure. A PfCRT structure would provide new insights into how the protein confers chloroquine resistance and thereby also yield novel opportunities for developing anti-malarial therapies. Although PfCRT is an attractive target for characterisation and structure determination, very little work has been published on its expression and purification. Here we present a medium throughput protocol, employing Sf9 insect cells, for testing the expression, stability and purification yield of rationally designed PfCRT mutant constructs and constructs of a PfCRT orthologue from Neospora caninum (NcCRT). We have identified a conserved cysteine residue in PfCRT that results in elevated protein stability when mutated. Combining this mutation with the insertion of T4-lysozyme into a specific surface loop further augments PfCRT protein yield and thermostability. Screening also identified an NcCRT construct with an elevated purification yield. Furthermore it was possible to purify both PfCRT and NcCRT constructs at milligram-scales, with high purities and with size exclusion chromatography profiles that were consistent with monodispersed, homogeneous protein.',\n",

AMA1, present on the surface of the parasite, binds tightly to the RON2 component of the RON protein complex, which is inserted into the erythrocyte membrane during invasion. Blocking the AMA1-RON2 interaction with antibodies or peptides inhibits invasion, underlining its importance in the Plasmodium life cycle and as a target for therapeutic strategies. We describe the crystal structure of the complex formed between AMA1 from P. vivax (PvAMA1) and a peptide derived from the externally exposed region of P. vivax RON2 (PvRON2sp1), and of the heterocomplex formed between P. falciparum AMA1 (PfAMA1) and PvRON2sp1.

Moreover, while PvRON2sp1 shows strong cross-reactivity with PfAMA1, PfRON2sp1 displays no detectable interaction with PvAMA1.

       " '28806082': 'Since the appearance of resistance to the current front-line antimalarial treatments, ACTs (artemisinin combination therapies), the discovery of novel chemical entities to treat the disease is recognized as a major global health priority. From the GSK antimalarial set, we identified an aminoxadiazole with an antiparasitic profile comparable with artemisinin (1), with no cross-resistance in a resistant strains panel and a potential new mode of action. A medicinal chemistry program allowed delivery of compounds such as 19 with high solubility in aqueous media, an acceptable toxicological profile, and oral efficacy. Further evaluation of the lead compounds showed that in vivo genotoxic degradants might be generated. The compounds generated during this medicinal chemistry program and others from the GSK collection were used to build a pharmacophore model which could be used in the virtual screening of compound collections and potentially identify new chemotypes that could deliver the same antiparasitic profile.',\n",
       " '28803842': 'Over 50 avian Plasmodium species have been described. However, PCR-based information shows much broader diversity of genetic lineages in these parasites. This discrepancy indicates insufficient knowledge about taxonomic diversity and boundaries of a single species in avian Plasmodium species. In recent taxonomy, most of genetically closely related lineages that share the same morphology and development patterns are attributed to the same biological species, but there is no information if these lineages are able to cross. This information is crucial to understand if these lineages form single or multiple evolutionary units. Due to presence of sexual process and sporogonic development of Plasmodium parasites in mosquitoes, self and cross-fertilization can occur and be identified during the oocyst stage. We initiated in vivo hybridization experiments of two widespread Plasmodium relictum lineages (pSGS1 and pGRW11) in experimentally infected Culex pipiens pipiens form molestus mosquitoes. To study putative hybrid oocysts, we used a laser microdissection technique together with PCR-based analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear genes. We demonstrate that both pSGS1 and pGRW11 lineages develop in infected mosquitoes in parallel, but also form hybrid oocysts of these two lineages. Our results are in accord to a recent global phylogeographic study of P. relictum that suggested that cross-fertilization between pSGS1 and pGRW11 might occur. This information helps to understand population structure, gene flow and the evolutionary process of haemosporidian parasites.',\n",

The protein has a central repeat region that belongs to one of repeat families (VK210, VK247, and the P. vivax-like). In the present study, computer modelling was employed to select chimeric proteins, comprising the conserved regions and different arrangements of the repeat elements (VK210 and VK247), whose structure is similar to that of the native counterparts. DNA encoding the selected chimeras (named CS127 and CS712) were synthetically constructed based on E. coli codons, then cloned and expressed. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; anti-Pv-210-CDC and -Pv-247-CDC), recognized the chimeric antigens in ELISA, indicating correct conformation and accessibility of the B-cell epitopes. ELISA using IgG from plasma samples collected from 221 Iranian patients with acute P. vivax showed that only 49.32% of the samples reacted to both CS127 and CS712 proteins.

       " '28800458': 'Malaria, in particular infection with P.\\xa0falciparum (the most lethal of the human malaria parasite species, responsible for nearly one million deaths every year), is one of the most devastating and common infectious disease throughout the world. Beginning with quinine, quinoline containing compounds have long been used in clinical treatment of malaria and remained the mainstays of chemotherapy against malaria. The emergence of P.\\xa0falciparum strains resistant to almost all antimalarials prompted medicinal chemists and biologists to study their effective replacement with an alternative mechanism of action and new molecules. Combination with variety of quinolines and other active moieties may increase the antiplasmodial and antimalarial activities and reduce the side effects. Thus, hybridization is a very attractive strategy to develop novel antimalarials. This review aims to summarize the recent advances towards the discovery of antiplasmodial and antimalarial hybrids including quinoline skeleton to provide an insight for rational designs of more active and less toxic quinoline hybrids antimalarials.',\n",

Here, we present stranded RNA-seq data generated directly from a small volume of blood from three Cambodian vivax malaria patients collected before treatment. Our analyses show surprising similarities of the parasite gene expression patterns across infections, despite extensive variations in parasite stage proportion. These similarities contrast with the unique gene expression patterns observed in sporozoites isolated from salivary glands of infected Colombian mosquitoes. Our analyses also indicate that more than 10% of P. vivax genes encode multiple, often undescribed, protein-coding sequences, potentially increasing the diversity of proteins synthesized by blood stage parasites.

They are from separate protease superfamilies, however, members often have overlapping substrate specificity. Inhibitors of one or both enzymes can be used to modulate hypertension, reduce proliferation of certain types of cancers and control malaria parasites. Current inhibitors act to chelate the zinc ions in the active site, locking the enzymes in an inactive transition state. We were interested in using a computational approach to understand the structure and dynamics of the M1 and M17 aminopeptidases, however, the presence of the essential metal ions in the proteases presents a challenge to classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The zinc amber force field does not contain applicable descriptions of the zinc coordination environment present in either of these two protease families. To provide tools for the study of these two enzymes, we have used the metal centre parameter builder to generate new hybrid bonded/nonbonded force field (FF) parameters to correctly describe the active site architecture for each enzyme. The new parameters were evaluated by fitting the normal mode frequencies of molecular mechanics to the quantum mechanics frequencies and validated by performing short MD simulations. The new FF parameters now enable more accurate and reliable MD simulations for any member of the M1 or M17 aminopeptidase superfamilies.',\n",
